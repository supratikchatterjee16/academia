# IELTS exam
 
There are two types of  IELTS: 
1. Academic
2. General Training.

All test takers take the same Listening and Speaking tests but different Reading and Writing tests.

## Strategies

The following strategies of a person reasonably well versed in English.

One important fact to remember, IELTS is a proficiency test, not a competitive one.
You are marked on being proficient, not on your understanding of techniques.

### Listening

This depends heavily on note taking methods(not to be confused with transcribing). Each section has a brief period before the narrative, where the sceanrio description is given, and time is provided to study the questions.

Note taking skills depend on abbreviations for fast transcriptions. Have a list of abbreviations that you are comfortable with and understand at a moments notice.

Some concepts for use are found in :

* [California State University, Northridge](https://www.csun.edu/~hcpas003/effective.html)
* [SkillsYouNeed](https://www.skillsyouneed.com/write/notes-verbal.html)
* [University of North Carolina](https://learningcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/using-concept-maps/)

Some key ideas:

1. Make use of Concept maps
2. Make use of Cornell Method

#### Cornell Method(Monologue strategy)

Divide page into a summary area(bottom), a recall area(left), and the note taking area in that order.

Write notes in the ‘note taking area’.  After the event fill in any gaps in your notes, try to leave some white space between points.  For each major point or idea covered in your notes write a ‘cue word’ or ‘keyword’ in the recall area of your sheet.

Use the summary area to write a brief summary of what your sheet contains – it may be useful to colour code this area. The summary will help you to find relevant notes later when you need to review them – this is especially useful for students when revising for exams or writing an assignment.

#### Concept Maps(Monologue, Dialogue strategy)

This concept is where the concept of idea webs are derived from.

For people who understand what a directed acyclic map is, we create that, using the speach found.

#### Transcription(Conversation between more than 2 agents)

Methods 
1. Speaker Labelling
2. Timestamps
3. Using markers or tagging with audio description

Guidelines : 

* Accuracy. Only type the words that are spoken in the audio file. Phrases or words you don't understand should not be omitted. Instead, they should be tagged appropriately according to the company's guidelines.
* US English. Use proper US English capitalization, punctuation and spelling. Do not write phonetics or netspeak such as “u” for “you'.
* Do Not Paraphrase. Do not correct the speaker's grammar nor rearrange words. Also, do not cut words that you think are off-topic or irrelevant. Any words not spoken should not be included. Type the actual words spoken.
* Do Not Add Additional Information. Do not add additional information such as page numbers, job numbers, titles or your comments in your submission. Such information can be added in separate fields below the transcript.
* “Clean Up” Non-Verbatim Jobs. Lightly edit non-verbatim work to remove false starts, filler, and stutters. Check the company's guidelines on what should be removed.
* Verbatim Work Should Be Truly Verbatim. When transcribing verbatim work, include every utterance and sound exactly as you hear. Unless directed in the work's “Notes” section, all filler words should be included. Also, transcribe stutters as accurately as possible.


## Speaking

1. Practice and accent correction through mirroring is the best for this purpose.
2. Control your monkey brain, if it is hard to keep your thoughts congruent.
3. Focus on the listener interest rather than on the topic itself.
4. Long forms require you to understand story telling

### Story Telling(Long form)

Go through [this link from Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/storytelling-in-business).

#### Strategy for story telling for IELTS

When presented with a topic, first draw a conclusion with regards to the topic.
For example, say someone gives a topic such as "Bonfire".

Your task is to reduce the time required for you to work out the story, in order to do so, we have to draw a conclusion first.

For example, one conclusion could be "Bonfires, while a fire hazard, can be a very enjoyable experience" or another could be "The togetherness of planning and executing a large bonfire".

It could be just about anything, but it has to be worked out fast and right at the first, as that will be the premise of the story, we narrate.

Part 3 consists of a discussion form based on this story, so the more unreasonable the conclusion, the easier the discussion on it. But, unreasonable should not mean absurd.

We can finesse this through increasing the value, making it effectively a multi-point story. But with 2 minutes of talk time, one would be better off using once conclusion for their story.
