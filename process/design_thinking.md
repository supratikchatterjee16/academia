# Design Thinking

David Kelly & Tim Brown

Design Thinking : 

Focus on needs of user.
Understand Context and Culture.
Observation and Qualitative Data.

Emphathize -> Define -> Ideate -> Prototype -> Test
(EDIPT)

Idea Generation : 

Brainstorming & Worst Possible Idea

## Leading Design Thinking

1. Frame probems on available inputs
2. Allow experimentation, prioritizing hardest functionalities or features and fail fast methodology
3. Communicating Ideas with a mult skilled team
4. Collaborate

Innovating downsides
1. Being ready to accept risks
2. Being able to work with half baked ideas
3. Being ready to bend rules
4. Being agile and able to respond quickly
5. Personal Passion
6. Recognize skills required to build the team

**Team Leap** is a team trust building exercise in which discussions are held for finding goals and aspirations.

## Customer Experience

This is a central part of Human Centered Design, which is required for Design Thinking.

1. Archetypes
2. Activities
3. Interactions
4. Principles

Archetypes : Describe patterns of behaviors, attitudes, and motivations shared between people towards a brand or products

Activities : Capture actions and goals of a customer across end-to-end experience, from their perspective

## Hypothesis Generation

If, then, because format.

If : Challenge or Opportunity
Then : Desired Affect
Because : Rationale with insights


Example, for creating an easily accessible drone coordinations system : 

If there was a readily available framework for creating cooperative hives for drones
Then It would essentially enable a large group of willing participants to leverage it for prototyping
Because it is difficult for drone researchers to develop and deploy secure reactive networks for prototyping

Journey Maps need to be maintained to orient the long term goals of teams.

## Synthesis

Make sense of problemss and turn them into actionable sequence of actions

Extreme Use Cases, Metaphors, Analogies, etc.

## Concepting 

1. Delay Judgemet
2. Supportive Culture
3. Visualizing and Making things tangible

This requires Lateral Thinking and the **Six Thinking Hats Method**

### Six Thinking Hats

1. Blue Hat(Conductor) : Controls personal thinking and manages the decision making process
2. Green Hat(Creative) : Explore a range of ideas and possible ways forward
3. Red Hat(Heart) : Express feelings without justifying
4. Yellow Hat(Optimist) : Look at issues in the most positive ways. Look only at benefits/
5. Black Hat(Judge) : Cautious and Assessing risks
6. White Hat(Factual) : Information Gatherer, using collected knowledge and insights

### Data Intelligence

1. Recommendation engine
2. Cash Flow preictor
3. Decision Engine

Data Intelligence in Concepting

After collecting all the data, during the process of idea generation and concept creation, ask these four questions to implement data intelligence to the concepts.

* Do you need more clarity?
* Do you need more time?
* Do you need more knowledge?
* Do you need more guidance?

If the concept answers any of these questions, then pivot it to the concept using data intelligence methods like worksheets. They are the general analog method for recording data.

## Prototyping

Paper Prototypes
Animatics
Comprehencive prototype
Low Fidelity
High Fidelity
Wireframes
Walk Throughs
Maquettes

Things to accept:
1. Failure 
2. Iterations
3. Revisit Phases

Prototyping Guidelines

Several guidelines can be followed while developing a prototype.

Start building: The first guideline is to start building the prototype from whatever ideas you have conceptualized without thinking about the outcome.

Don't spend Much time: Prototypes are built for experiencing the concepts and not for developing a fully functional product. So much time should not be wasted in building them. prototypes

Fail Fast: Prototypes must be built in quick successions and fail agile methodology must be implemented in which each prototype is built by learning from the previous failure.

Remember the concept: The concept on which the prototype is being built must be remembered, and care must be taken not to deviate from it.

Keep the user in mind: The whole design thinking concept is user-centered, so the prototypes built must be user-centered too. The high fidelity prototypes that provide user interaction must design the prototypes by keeping the users in mind.

Types of Prototyping

Prototyping is of many kinds, but the two widely used terms are:

### Low Fidelity Prototyping:

In low fidelity prototyping, prototypes are built using papers, stickers or any materials that are readily available, and these prototypes are not necessarily working. They are made in quick iterations. Low fidelity prototypes usually do not have user interactions

### High Fidelity Prototyping:

In high fidelity prototyping, the prototypes are made using computer graphic tools, and real working prototypes are created. High Fidelity prototypes have user interactions.

Prototyping with Data

1. Data-driven prototyping
2. Data Prototyping

#### Data Driven Prototyping

In data-driven prototyping, you put the actual data collected into your web or mobile application prototypes and build charts, menus, and drop-down boxes just like in the real application.

In data-driven prototyping, the designers and data scientists must work collaboratively to build prototypes based on real-time data and can decide upon which prototyping tools to use.

Apps that help with this are : 

1. JustinMind
2. InVision(Feedback Grid, reverse Brainstorming, The 5 Whys)
3. Axure RP

#### Data Prototyping

Data prototyping is a technique where raw data from different sources is developed into a dataset and how those datasets can be transformed into useful concepts and prototypes for the end users.

Data prototyping is generally used in places where Data Migration is needed. Data integration is required and where applications are developed.

Data prototyping is similar to Design Prototyping where mock-ups are created to explain the concepts created using data intelligence.
