# Collaboration between Business Analyst and Project Manager

Why Projects Fail

1. Lack of stakeholder engagement and involvement
2. Changing priorities
3. Changing requirements

How is success defined 

1. Collaborate with stakeholders to understand this

Project manager delivers projects within budget, schedule and quality measures

Business Analyst ensures deliverables are valuable and meets customer needs

## Project vs Product

Larger project needs a PM and multiple BAs

1. Project is a temporary initiative to create a product; Has an end date; Has PMs focus
2. Product is something that delivers value; Lives on; BAs focus

PM defines estimates and schedule and provides it to BA. BA defines Scope questions and passes to PM.

## Overlaps

1. Scoping and Planning
2. Communications
3. Stakeholder management
4. Risk Management

## Triple Constraint

1. Cost
2. Scope
3. Schedule

These 3 act like a rubber band.

Portfolio level collab :

PM : 
Budget links
Schedule links
Strategic Alignment

BA :
Strategic Alignment
Business Architecture
Impacted Groups

1. Define the problem or opportunity
2. Define the value proposition for the stakeholders
3. Determine measurable goals
4. Determine missing capabilities(Innovation, Systems, Behaviour, Processes)
5. Look at feasibility(Technical, Cost, Schedule, Business design, People)
6. Prioritize portfolio items

Cost Feasibility:

1. ROI
2. Net present value
3. Business Case
4. Cost of delay
5. Weighted shortest job first

Table to help with costing : 

| | Minimum | Likely | Maximum |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cost | 250,000 | 500,000 | 1,000,000 |
| Benefit | 100,000 | 750,000 | 2,000,000 |

Scopes : 

1. Project Scope : Work to be done and resources to do it
2. Product Scope : What the project builds
3. Functional Scope : What features, goals, and functions will be provided
4. Technical Scope : What tech is impacted
5. Organizational Scope : What locations, units, and groups are impacted

Scope creep

Scopes are added without cost evaluations

Estimating and Planning Together

1. What the product is
2. Expected outcomes
3. Upcoming pieces
4. Impacted groups
5. Risk profile
