# Product Management

Understanding how to manage all aspects of a product is Product Management

Design, Build, Test, Release

## Difference with Project Management

Product Management focuses on 

1. Users enjoy the product
2. Users find it valuable
3. Product integrates succesfully

Project Management focuses on 

1. Schedules
2. Evaluates and Manages the Resource


**Pivot** to change direction when something isn't working as planned.

Product Manager

1. Connects all Stakeholders
2. Approve decisions affecting the direction of the product

Research -> Prototype -> Development -> Marketing -> Business -> Communication

Partner with people, do not dictate the way the product takes. Manipulate slightly, but do not dominate.

Always Listen.

Stakeholders(Broadly) : 

1. Research Groups
2. Finance
3. Public Relations
4. Legal
5. Business Operations(TAM)(Estimate reach)
6. Business Development(Sepcial ways of using your product)
7. Executives/Investor
8. Users

Waterfall and Agile methodologies.

Hardware uses Waterfall(Planning at begin, Monitor team progress)
Software uses Agile

Research : Audience size, Problems solved, etc.
Plan : Timeline, Features and Project Plan
Build : Features, Test, Certify
Release : Make available, Beta Test
Refine : Evaluate
Retire : Decommision(End of Life)

Create deliverables to move from one phase to another.

Waterfall : Might take a year(Hardware)
Agile : 1-x weeks and is parallel(Mots softwares)

## Research Plan

Surveys :

1. Quantitative : Lots of Data, Standardized Q & A, Result reveals trends
2. Qualitative :  In-depth info from small group, open ended questions

When to use Quantitative?

1. Size of Surveys
2. Margin of error
3. Reliability

Error increase with population size.

1. Internal Data : From the product
2. External Data : From users

|    | Quantitative | Qualitative |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Internal** | | |
| **External** | | |

### Customer meeting

Who will attend?

Need individuals that will be a part of the whole process

Product Manager
User Experience
Engineering
Marketing

Who will you interview?

3 - 5 people attending.

Agree on critical points

Schedule the meeting.

100 USD analogy. Get importance of the features.

Post meeting : 

1. What went well and what didn't?
2. What was the best thing I heard in the meeting?
3. What was the worst thing?

### Product Requirements and Stories

Define a feature and associate it with a user.  
The user can be an internal user(developer) and external user(customers)  
Decide punting requirements based on timelines.

1. Break them up into smaller features
2. Increase capacity or increasing productive time by cutting 'busy work'

1. Define overall schedule
2. Identify Market conditions and prioritize features using radial map
3. Provide summarized User Stories for developers and marketing teams to refer using a template

## Building

Burndown Chart. Velocity is the speed at which the team develops the product.
Burndowns show the estimated and actual amount of work performed and how many sprints are completed.

1. Punt planned features to next sprint
2. Allow more time in the next sprint

Ninety-Ninety rule : The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the first 90 percent of the development time. The remaining 10 percent of the code accounts for the other 90 percent of the development time.  
-Tom Cargill, Bell Labs

Certifying that the product is okay for release:
Legal Review for Digital Media nad Libraries
Patenting
Security Review and Code Review
Comply with government testing, vendor policies, rating from Entertainment Board, Software Rating Board

## Release

Define your go-to market.  
Build persona for verifying releases against.
Let 'Zack' be a niche user important for your application. Always think will it be relevant for 'Zack'.
Do not check current and potential personas when defining go-to market.

Build Persona for both users and marketing team.

1. Discovered Needs
2. Set priorities
3. Defined User Stories
4. Established ppersonas
5. Developed communications
6. Created Marketing plans

1. Soft Launch(release before marketing)
2. Full Launch(product launch and marketing simultaneous)

Phased relase strategy

## Refine

|  | Current Users | Non-Users |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Personas** | 1 | 2 |
| **Not Personas** | 3 | 4 |

For 1:

1. Product solves their problem
2. Find value in product

For 2:

1. Check Awareness
2. How did they find out about it?
3. Why doon't they use it?

For 3:

Adding features for unconsidered audience, can increase market significantly.

For 4:

Check attitude.

Funnel :

The size of audience goes down, moving downwards through the following : 

1. All potential users
2. Reached by marketing
3. Sought out more info
4. Possible users
5. Current Users

Churn Themes

1. Poor positioning
2. Price Objections
3. Unaware of product

Ways to check usage of the apps:

1. Feature traffic
2. Session Time
3. User flow maps/Cohorts

### Net Promoter Score : 

Ask a simple question : would you promote the product to another user?

Scale of 1-10

10-9 : Promoter and Fans
7-8 : Passives
6-lower : detractors

NPS = Promoters - Detractors(in percentage)

Passives are ignored.

Planning product updates : 

1. Account Unknown Personas
2. Technical Debt 

If technical debt is too large, building from scratch might be easier. Retire product.


## Retire

1. New product replacing a previous one. Migration strategy required.
2. Product becomes Obsolete.
3. Technical debt is too high.
4. Market conditions

Be honest, transparent and proactive.

Respond to concerns and migrate to other products.
Leave in market, but unsupported.
