# Decision Making

The process of selecting a choice from a range of possible options , with the goal of achieving a very specific objective.

Principles

1. Objective should be clear
2. Choose who decides and who doesn't
3. Reduce ambiguity and risk
4. Make a choice and make it known
5. Evaluate and adjust based on new information

**Prepare -> Decide -> Communicate -> Execute -> Measure and Adjust**

Defining the decision :

1. What is the desired outcome?
2. What are the choices we are planning to make?
3. What are the possible choices?
4. What is the timeline?
5. Who will the decision affect?

Decision-Making Styles

1. Autocratic : Small size, High urgency
2. Participatory : Larger decision with higher urgency with bigger impact
3. Democratic : Mid size and low urgency
4. Consensus : No urgency but high impact

Dimensions

2. Business Cases

## RACI Matrix

For deciding stakeholders.

1. Responsible
2. Accountable
3. Consulted
4. Informed

## Ambiguity

4 states : 

1. Highly Predictable
2. Distinct Possibilities
3. Spectrum of Outcomes
4. Complete Unpredictability

### Highly predictable

1. Easy to forecas
2. Little incremental input
3. Fewer parties invovled

Typical examples of ambiguity : 

1. How will customers receive a change?
2. How many will buy?

Reduce Ambiguity

1. Confirm customer count
2. Run a focus group

### Distinct Possibilities

Equal likelihood of n number of outcomes.

Reduce Ambiguity

1. Forecast results
2. Market Research

### Spectrum of Outcomes

When there is a lot of variations of outcomes for a particular decision.

Gathering inputs from multiple stakeholders.

### Unpredictability

Phased Decision Making for reducing unpredictability:

1. Decide
2. Gather Data
3. Decide

Reduce ambiguity by :

1. Running a pilot
2. Speaking with regulators
3. Analyzing competition
4. Review economic forecast

## making a Decision

3 types of decision 

1. No downside
2. Favourable odds
3. Going for Broke

Goal of decision making

1. Make the best decision
2. Reduce ambiguity

3 primary method of reducing risk : 

1. Involve people into the decision making

3. Events that would lead to a reversal

Execution Risks :

1. Passive Aggresive behaviour
2. New information
3. New Events

1. Set clear metrics
2. Resolve sources of uncertainty
3.
