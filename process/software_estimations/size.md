## Estimation Models

1. Function Point : Measure software from the end-user's PoV. IFPUG FPA is most commonly used.
2. Feature Point : Similar to Function point but bridges some gap in IFPUG FPA.
3. Technical Components : Non-standardized model of sizing based on number of technical components. Types of projects that use this are Development, Data Warehousing, Business Intelligence and Prerformance Management.
4. Use Case Point : Relies on identified use cases for typical object-oriented developments. Uses use-case complexity and actors in estimating. 
5. Lines of Code : Source Lines of Codes is a conventional way of measuring application size in terms of number of lines of code. For larger developments KLoC(Kilo LoC) is used.
6. PROBE : Proxy Based Estimation. The idea is that if the developer is developing something previously they may have worked upon, then it takes the same effort as it did previously.
