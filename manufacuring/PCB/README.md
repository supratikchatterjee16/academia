# Manufacturing Printed Circuit Boards(PCB)

PCB : an electronic circuit consisting of thin strips of a conducting material such as copper, which have been etched from a layer fixed to a flat insulating sheet called a printed circuit board, and to which integrated circuits and other components are attached.

A PCB has 2 parts to it : 

1. Base material
2. Conductor or High Purity Copper foil

While the coductor layer is ust that, the base material can vary. We explore this next.

## Base Materials

### Standard thicknesses of rigid material:

0,5 mm / 0,8 mm / 1,0 mm / 1,2 mm / 1,6 mm / 2,0 mm / 2,4 mm / 3,2 mm / other thicknesses on request.

Polyimide can also be used as a rigid base material when reinforced with glass fibre, thickness 1,6 mm, other thicknesses on request.
