# Decision Sciences

Decision Sciences is the study of quantitative and qualitative techniques used to understand and improve decision-making by analyzing data, modeling uncertainty, optimizing outcomes, and incorporating human behavior and strategic thinking.

## Elements of Decision Sciences

| **Element**      | **What it Involves**                                                                          |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Descriptive**  | Understanding how decisions are actually made (often using behavioral and cognitive science). |
| **Prescriptive** | Recommending optimal decisions using models, optimization, and simulations.                   |
| **Predictive**   | Using data and statistical/machine learning models to forecast outcomes.                      |
| **Normative**    | Defining how decisions *should* be made under rationality and utility theories.               |

## Types of Decisions

### 1. **By Structure**

| **Type**                      | **Description**                                                   | **Examples**                              |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Structured Decisions**      | Routine, repetitive, rule-based; can be automated                 | Inventory reordering, payroll processing  |
| **Unstructured Decisions**    | Complex, novel, no clear procedure; high uncertainty              | Entering a new market, product innovation |
| **Semi-Structured Decisions** | Combination of both; partial rules but also human judgment needed | Loan approvals, hiring decisions          |

### 2. **By Scope**

| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Strategic Decisions**   | Long-term, high-impact, often unstructured               | Mergers, business model selection        |
| **Tactical Decisions**    | Medium-term, implement strategic goals                   | Marketing campaigns, resource allocation |
| **Operational Decisions** | Day-to-day, often structured, support tactical decisions | Inventory restocking, scheduling         |

| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Descriptive Decisions**  | Focus on understanding actual behavior and processes            | Why consumers choose brand A over B    |
| **Normative Decisions**    | Ideal decisions based on logic, probability, and utility theory | Maximizing expected return             |
| **Prescriptive Decisions** | Provide actionable recommendations based on models              | Portfolio optimization, route planning |

### 4. **By Environment**

| **Type**                        | **Description**                                            | **Examples**                                  |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Decisions under Certainty**   | All outcomes and probabilities are known                   | Choosing the cheaper of two known prices      |
| **Decisions under Risk**        | Probabilities of outcomes are known                        | Investing in stock with known volatility      |

| **Individual Decisions**     | Made by a single decision-maker             | Choosing a job offer                  |
| **Group Decisions**          | Made collectively by a team or group        | Boardroom decisions, committee voting |
