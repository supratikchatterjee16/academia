# Basic Statistic Models in Decision Sciences

We explore the basic statistical models used in decision sciences here.

The basic models include:

- Central Limit Theorem
- Distributions
- Dispersions
- Population
- Sample
- T Test
- Z Test
- Chi Square test
- ANOVA and MANOVA
- Matrix Operations, Determinants, Vectors and Eigen values

Applications for prescreptive decisions - LiSP/LINGO.

Methods for Predective decision making:

- Time Series Analysis
    - Moving Average
    - Exponential
    - Holtz & Winter-Holts Model
- Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average Models

Multi-criteria decision science:

- Interpretive Structural Modeling(ISM)
- Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory(DEMATEL)
- Analytic Hierarchy Process(AHP)
- Interpretive Ranking Process(IRP)
- Analytic Network Process(ANP)
- Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution(TOPSIS)
