## Benefits Realization

What expenditure provides a benefit?

### Portfolio Management

Portfolio : All Programs and Projects under an organisation
Program : A set of activities with no end, such as an information security program
Project : A set of activities with a beginning, middle and end designed to achieve a specific goal.

Important points : 
* All must be coordinated and fit together.
* All are designed to achieve the business objective
* All projects in the portfolio should be maintained in a portfolio database
* Should follow well-defined processes and frameworks
* Each project or program must have it's business case

Before starting the project there must be a business case or reason for why it should be performed.

Business Case Elements :

1. Feasibility Study(requirements, approach, analysis of alternatives, ROI)
2. Management Approval

## IT Project Management

Programs vs Project : 
1. Programs are onngoing
2. Projects have a clear beginning, middle and end

Project Phases : 

1. Initiate
2. Plan
3. Execute
4. Control and Monitor
5. Close out

### Initiate

Scope : Boundaries to narrow down requirements.
Scope Creep : Add more elements and features that broaden the scope or are out of them
Scope Statement : The details and constraints specifying the scope

Questions to answer:
1. What are the exact details?
2. Who will lead and execute the project?

Identify and Interview the Stakeholders.
Do not create requirements on your own.

### Plan

Work Breakdown Structure : Breaks down the project into small manageable tasks that should be budgeted, scheduled, and executed.

For the WBS :

Factor in :

1. Resources and duration
2. Dependencies

Critical Path :

1. The series of activities that, if changed will change the end date of the project
2. Auditor should look for the critical path of the project

Gantt Chart : 

For displaying what is required to be completed to start the next task.

Define project resource and budget : 

1. Build vs Buy
2. In-house or external
   1. Internal resources - we have all resources, tailor the WBS to the resources that are available, may require new staff, may require new tech
   2. External resources - conduct competitive selection if time/resources allow, establish contracts and SoW, define deliverable, milestones and obligations, SLA

Assess Project Risks. Risk assessment via ranking.

Types in IT : 

1. Technical : New development with limited know-how
2. Scheduled : Promised day is missed, causing increased budget
3. Budget : Costing is high

Document the plan

1. It will serve as a roadmap
2. Can be followed
3. Plans can be communicated

### Execute, Control and Monitor

1. Follow the plan
2. Track Metrics
3. Monitor to avoid scope creep
4. Monitor Costs, Budget and risk
5. Communicate
6. Report Status within team and management
7. Hold staff and vendors accountable
8. Adjust the plan as needed

### Project Closeout

1. Archive project records
2. Dispose materials securely
3. Close out contracts
4. Shut down expenditures
5. Update final project cost accounting
6. Conduct lessons learnt
7. Throw a party

### Auditing Project Management

Does the organization have written doctrine about project management and are they following it?

Is there a project plan, and is it being followed?

Are the organizations PM practices adequate?

1. How often are the projects on time and on budget?
2. Are there any processes based on industry stamdards and best practices?

How well is communication done?
1. Is there a communication plan defined for the project?

### IT Service Provider Acquisition and Management

Virtually any IT service cAN BE OUTSOURCED :

1. Infra services(X-as-a-service)
2. Engineering services(applications, computing, storage, network, security)
3. Operations services(help desk, network monitoring, security monitoring)
4. Assurance services(auditing and security)

Factors impacting the decision :

1. Proprietary nature of the service
2. Critical nature of the service
3. Level of control or monitoring
4. Cost
5. Risk
6. Trust

Services can be outsources but liability can't. 

The organizations retain liability, therefore mechanisms must be in place for the organization to ensure proper performance, quality, security and so on.

### Systems Development Life Cycle

A structures process for developing something.

They all have these basic components : 

1. Project Initiation
2. Functional design analysis and planning
3. Systems design spec
4. Development
5. Testing, implementation
6. Operational/Maintenance
7. Revision/Replacement/Destruction


Is it sequential or iterative?

Industry Standards : 

1. ISO/IEC 42010:2007
2. SEI(Software Engineering Institute) IDEAL(Initiating, Diagnosing, Establishing, Acting and Learning) model for Software Process Improvement

Verification(did you build the product correctly) and Validation(did you build the right product) testing.
