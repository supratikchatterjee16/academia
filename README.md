# Academics

These are shared notes for easy access, when required to refer to for some very targeted applications.

Why this is being made, is to make sure that the structure and the list of tools that we are made aware of in the courses, are there listed, so that we know where to look for the information, when we need it, wherever we need it.

Additionally, there is another project for which this happens to work as an incredibly verbose dataset of well formulated sentences, as well as a dictionary of uncommon-common knowledge, or specialized common knowledge if you will.

It is more oriented towards revising for application later on, and for continual improvement based on practice of certain things.

The learnings are divided into 3 parts :

1. Business
2. Process
3. Technology
4. Leadership

The hierarchy of the matter will be continuously updated here, in order to accurately track the list of learning.

The same hierarchy could be made use of in order to mark which is being worked upon by who currently.

Each element is going to have some inter-connectivity. This is going to be maintained on GitHub, through cross references to the files.
Wherever an issue is spotted, feel free to correct. Feel free to add onto the content.

Please update this README when adding a new branch.

Elementary matter(101 course material) will be updated as README, at each subject/topic root.
It will have examples, deep problems, exercise materials and everything in between, to manage knowledge as best as possible.-->
