Shared notes for easy access, for reference, when dispensing a contextually required responsibility, and when working with industries at various stages of their development.

This contains reference materials for topics studied as well as practice, and proof of concepts of certain topics, to serve as a quick guide for implementations.


This is focused on industries and was originally divided into 4 parts :

1. Business
2. Process
3. Technology
4. Leadership

However, on further study, this was found to be a bit of an issue, in using process and leadership as individual topics, without introducing business contexts to them. Hence, as a result, the structure evolved in the following way:

- [Business](/business/README.md)
	- [Capabilities](/business/capability/README.md)
	- [Finance](/business/finance/README.md)
		- [Taxes](/business/finance/taxes/README.md)
	- [Leadership](/business/leadership/README.md)
	- [Industries](/business/industries/README.md)
	- [Operations](/business/operations/README.md)
	- [Sales](/business/sales/README.md)
	- [Marketing](/business/marketing/README.md)
	- [Research and Development](/business/research_and_development/README.md)
- [Technology](/technology/README.md)(to be structured better)
	- [Digital](/technology/digital/README.md)
	- [Statistics](/technology/statistics/README.md)
	- [Radio](/technology/radio/README.md)


On further analysis, there were some topics found that do not align to just businesses and technology, but both use them in various ways, i.e. are vastly interdisciplinary. These interdisciplinary topics will be focused on separately.

The topics currently are:

- [Sustainability](./sustainability/index.md)
- [Decision Sciences](./decision_science/index.md)
- [Systems Theory](./systems/index.md)
