Shared notes for easy access, for reference, when dispensing a contextually required responsibility, and when working with industries at various stages of their development.

This contains reference materials for topics studied as well as practice, and proof of concepts of certain topics, to serve as a quick guide for implementations.


This is focused on industries and was originally divided into 4 parts :

1. Business
2. Process
3. Technology
4. Leadership

However, on further study, this was found to be a bit of an issue, in using process and leadership as individual topics, without introducing business contexts to them. Hence, as a result, the structure evolved in the following way:

- [Business](/business/README.md)
	- [Capabilities](/business/capability/README.md)
	- [Finance](/business/finance/README.md)
		- [Taxes](/business/finance/taxes/README.md)
	- [Leadership](/business/leadership/README.md)
	- [Industries](/business/industries/README.md)
	- [Operations](/business/operations/README.md)
	- [Sales](/business/sales/README.md)
	- [Marketing](/business/marketing/README.md)
	- [Research and Development](/business/research_and_development/README.md)
- [Technology](/technology/README.md)(to be structured better)
	- [Digital](/technology/digital/README.md)
	- [Statistics](/technology/statistics/README.md)
	- [Radio](/technology/radio/README.md)

Structure

Originally, the structure was divided into the following:

- Business
- Process
- Technology

This was due to the understanding that those 3 can be observed as 3 separate topics, critical for understanding the entire business ecosystem.
However, on further study and work into the subject matter, it is glaringly apparent, that a vast majority of the processes are based on business contexts.

This means, that even though a process can be observed separately

Each element is going to have some inter-connectivity. This is going to be maintained on GitHub, through cross references to the files.
Wherever an issue is spotted, feel free to correct. Feel free to add onto the content.

Please update this README when adding a new branch.

Elementary matter(101 course material) will be updated as README, at each subject/topic root.
It will have examples, deep problems, exercise materials and everything in between, to manage knowledge as best as possible.-->
