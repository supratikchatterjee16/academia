## Changes in environment

### Multichannel retail

Until a few decades ago, the physical store was the only place people went to for shopping. With the advent of Internet and advancements in technology, when retailers opened up additional channels—online stores, mobile stores, mobile app stores, telephone sales, and other methods—it was a boon to the ‘hungry for more’ shopper. Brick-and-mortar retailers with deep pockets turned to multichannel as a strategic move to beat competition and acquire a large customer base.

Multichannel retail had its fair share of challenges. There was often little in common between what was available in the store, in a catalog, or online. Each channel offered multiple independent touchpoints to the consumer—many times selling different items. Orders were satisfied through separate supply chains. Inventory for store replenishment and wholesale orders was managed from one distribution center while inventory for online and catalog orders was managed from another facility or a third-party logistics provider.


### Cross-Channel Retail

Multichannel evolved into the cross-channel model, as retailers started offering common branding and messaging. However, from an operational perspective, retailers continued to operate in separate functional silos with various touchpoints for consumers.

In the absence of analytical tools, retailers lacked visibility into cross-channel customer behavior or cross-channel inventory. Without the ability to dynamically fulfill orders from any location, they were forced to keep buffer stocks at all locations. This often led to excess inventory, markdowns, and ultimately to a decrease in margin and profitability. In addition, relying on different technology stacks to operate the individual channels turned out to be a costly proposition.

Customers, on the other hand, were channel agnostic. They did not differentiate between channels and started looking for a consistent shopping experience across touchpoints. For instance, if they noticed that a particular product was available for a certain price on the retailer’s website, they expected to pay the same price if they chose to buy the product in a store. If they had filled in their contact/shipping address in a mail order catalog, they found it frustrating to register the same details all over again when shopping online.

### Omni Channel retail

Multichannel and cross-channel retailing innovations were driven by retailers who were trying to expand their sales. The transition from cross-channel to omnichannel retailing, on the other hand, is driven by customers. Customers are demanding an integrated, seamless shopping experience across all customer touchpoints. They want to buy from anywhere—in a store, on a laptop or PC, or from their phones and tablets; they want to pick it up from anywhere—in a store, at their work place, at their home, or sent to a friend; and they want to return it anywhere—to a store or back to a distribution point. Thus, omnichannel became a necessity.

Retailers also felt that it makes better business sense to have a synchronized operating model in which all channels are aligned. For instance, if a particular item was a top-seller on the website, stores should be able to ‘push’ excess stock to the online channel. Omnichannel, therefore, was perceived as a win-win proposition.


## Traditional vs Digital Customer Journey

Just when retailers thought omnichannel was the answer to customers’ rising expectations, social and mobile took the retail world by storm. Customers, who were hitherto connected to the Internet via laptops and desktops, were now shopping on the go via their 24x7 Wi-Fi-enabled smartphones. The rise of the ‘connected’ customer brought about a paradigm shift in the shopping journey.

The traditional customer journey followed a sequential path and was less complicated. First, customers discovered the need for a product and identified its existence. Next, they evaluated various options based on the perceived value. Then, they bought the product. Once satisfied with their purchase, they professed loyalty to the brand and formed a long-term engagement with the retailer.

The digital customer journey is non-linear, fragmented, and spaghetti-like. Customers hop from channel to channel, always on the lookout for the best deals. Their path to purchase is marked by lot of pre-shopping evaluations—checking out products in store, comparing prices online, reading up product reviews on social media, checking out product videos on YouTube, and even exchanging product reviews around the water cooler at work.

### Examples of the Digital Customer Journey

Let’s discuss two examples of the digital customer journey.

#### Example 1

John wants to present an iPhone as a birthday gift to his wife. He researches about the product on the Apple website via his Android tablet. The next day, he visits an Apple Store to check out the various models. Later, one of his friends tells him that the same products are available on an eCommerce site at a discounted rate. John logs on to the eCommerce site, and reads up product reviews and product ratings. He is happy with the reviews but is still undecided which model to go in for. So he posts on Facebook asking his friends for suggestions. He finally decides on iPhone 5. He buys the product from the eCommerce site as it is available at an attractive price and for free shipping.

#### Example 2

Ms. Alicia, an avid shopper, needs to get new footwear for her party in the evening. She accesses the website of her favorite retailer on her iPad and browses through the styles and colors. Alicia chooses a style and sees that it has received 680 ‘Likes’ on Facebook—information which is displayed next to the pricing details. On selecting the item, the website gives her various options from stock availability through to payment options, and order fulfillment (the nearest store based on Alicia’s current location, warehouses, direct-from-supplier, etc.). Alicia chooses the ‘reserve online’ option, and is satisfied to know that her order is ready. She drives to the nearest store to pick up her order on the way home from work. While in the store, she also purchases a matching wallet and belt to go with the new shoes.


## Role of Digital Technologies in Customer Journey

### Discover

In the Discover phase, shoppers use digital channels (Internet sites, e-mail, social media and blogs, in-store technologies) to learn about products and promotions. They also like to receive personalized offers and recommendations through digital channels, and messages and offers based on location.

### Explore

In the Explore phase, shoppers use digital channels (Internet sites, e-mail, social media and blogs, in-store technologies) for searching information, and for comparing and choosing products. Shoppers use digital devices such as kiosks, tablets, and mobile phones in store to aid in the shopping process, to order products not available in the store, or to scan barcodes to obtain product information.

### Buy

In the Buy phase, shoppers use in-store technology to help them find products, track spending, and pay for products. They use smartphone apps to check stock availability while walking around the store; receive real-time, location-based offers while in store; and scan barcodes to keep a running tally of the shopping cart value. They use mobile apps for making payments and identification via loyalty programs, etc.

### Engage

In the Engage phase, shoppers use Internet sites, e-mail, social media, and blogs to give feedback and receive help after purchases. Shoppers are also interested in reading reviews and feedbacks of other consumers.


## Impact of Omni-Channel on retailers

### Blurring boundaries between channels



Retailers are developing strategies to blur the boundaries between channels. These include:

Installing in-store technologies (Wi-Fi, kiosks, tablets) to enable shoppers to browse the entire inventory conveniently and place orders.
Using the store as:
	A display site for certain products, combined with home-delivery options.
	A collection point for online, mobile, and catalog orders.
	An experience zone to build loyalty.
Achieving broad presence across own and third-party online sites to maximize selling opportunities. For example, Apple products can be purchased from the Apple website as well as from a marketplace like Flipkart or Amazon.
Offering flexible delivery options for items purchased through non-store channels. For example, customers can buy a product online and choose to pick it up from a neighborhood store to avoid shipping costs.
Using new technologies such as location recognition to push context-aware messages to customers via their smartphones or equipping store associates with mobile devices that allow them to view the consumer’s purchase history across channels for targeted sales.

### Seamless shopping experience

Digital consumers are looking for a 'seamless' omnichannel shopping experience. They should be able to start a transaction from any channel and take it forward to completion in any other channel of interaction. They want to be able to:

Buy online and pick up in store.
Try a product in store and get it delivered at home, if the color/design they want is out of stock in the local store.
Place an order on a mobile device and be assured that the item is not only available, but also be able to choose how much to pay for shipping and know exactly when it will be delivered.
Order online, have it delivered at home, and return the product to a store.

### Fulfillment from anywhere



Leading retailers are moving to a 'fulfill from anywhere' model, too.

Best Buy has kiosks in hotels and airports where customers can purchase a camera or camcorder on the spot.
Macy’s is converting over 400 of their stores to double up as distribution nodes to align with the ‘ship-from-store’ model.
With Amazon changing the rules of the game with their ever-increasing service enhancements such as ‘same-day delivery’, the bar is just getting higher for retailers.

### Personalized engagement



Customers are seeking better deals—lower prices, better value, larger range, and quicker fulfillment. This has commoditized retail, forcing retailers to differentiate themselves through value-added, personalized interactions. To do this, retailers need to create a 360-degree view of the customer by recording every customer interaction—adding items to the wish list, purchasing items from the gift registry, showrooming, downloading mobile apps, scanning coupons, conversations with customer support agents, social media activities, and product reviews. This information can then be leveraged in online channels to make personalized product recommendations such as 'You may also like' and offer targeted discounts. In the case of brick and mortar, stores associates can be empowered with mobile devices to access customer data and offer customized service.

### Changing shopping behaviours

Showrooming. Showrooming is the practice of visiting a physical store to try out a product, understand its features and specifications, comparing the in-store and online price through mobile devices, and buying the product online if it is available at a lower price.

Webrooming. Webrooming is the reverse of showrooming. Customers research the product online and then buy it from a store. Nearly all shoppers have an online spending limit and prefer to go to a store for high value purchases.

Social media influence. Customers no longer rely on online product reviews and recommendations alone. They research products and services through Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and other social media sites—brand pages, testimonials, likes, and posts. Retailers are using social media to build brand visibility, listen to the social media sentiments of customers, advertise deals, and offer discounts based on ‘Likes’, etc.

Eroding loyalty. Omnichannel customers do not give a second thought about switching to a competitor if they can find better pricing or perceive that they can receive better service elsewhere. To stay competitive, retailers must provide access to a wider assortment of items. If they choose to stock additional items in their assortment, they will have the increased carrying cost of inventory as well as the challenge of forecasting the demand for the additional items across channels. On the other hand, if an item is not in stock when a customer wants it, they will lose a sale and quite possibly a customer. Brand loyalty is hard to come by and retain.

### Challenges in defining an Omnichannel strategy

#### Gaining a clearer customer view across multiple channels

Consumers are increasingly sharing valuable information through social data, product reviews, and online visits and purchases. The challenge for retailers here is to capture data across multiple channels so it can be analyzed and translated into useful information. Leading retailers are using predictive analytics to gain deeper insight into customer behaviors, trends, and the forces of loyalty and purchase. Retailers who take advantage of sophisticated algorithms and data-mining activities—which analyze current social data, product reviews, and historical facts to track shopping patterns—have a greater ability to create an individual shopping experience based on rich information sources.

#### Making products ‘web-ready’

Making products ‘web-ready’ is an important component of a successful omnichannel retail operation, but is currently a bottleneck for many retailers. Key product information, attributes, and images are not always accurate, standardized, or readily available for retailers or their trading partners. However, emerging standards in this area can provide the foundation for identifying, capturing and sharing product data, and providing the industry with the opportunity to collaborate on bringing products to the online marketplace faster.

#### Remaining competitive in an ever-changing market

The complexity of omnichannel retail, coupled with the pressures of competing with larger and often international companies that have greater purchasing power, has led many mid-market retailers to find ways of reducing traditional supply chain layers. For example, some have chosen to deal directly with manufacturers, have started importing, or have changed their product range to cater to less competitive niches.

#### Providing added value

In the era of bricks-and-mortar retail, most businesses had a speculative understanding of customer interests and behaviors. eCommerce now offers retailers a wealth of customer information, letting them monitor and tailor brand messages to specific demographics or even individual customers. The challenge for retailers is to translate this information into marketing and merchandising that is meaningful to their target customers.

#### Fulfillment strategy

Fulfillment options need to be robust and varied. To be successful, retailers must streamline order fulfillment processes and put technology in place to automate and accelerate shipping, tracking, and other critical transport and delivery processes. By using their stores as distribution centers, retailers are better positioned to deliver products quickly to the customer.

Store fulfillment offers the promise of leveraging existing infrastructure and labor to reduce the burden on a growing eCommerce business. It can be used to provide the following fulfillment options:

    Buy online, pick up in store
    Buy online, ship-from-store (to consumer)
    Site-to-store fulfillment (i.e., pick up in a store to which the inventory has been transferred from another facility)
    Store-to-store transfers
    Claims/recall shipments
    Returns (to DC, to vendor)

#### Inventory visibility

Retailers need the ability to have a consolidated, accurate view of real-time inventory across stores and distribution centers to maximize availability and fulfillment efficiency. But, multiple systems, disjointed processes, and lack of insight into outsourced fulfillment partners make realizing a transparent order-to-delivery process difficult. Retailers need to align business processes and technology across channels to ensure that customers can purchase, fulfill, and return orders through any channel—all while preserving end-to-end visibility and a single customer-centric view so that retailers can respond quickly and accurately to customer requests.

#### Order management

With orders originating from multiple channels, there will be demand against existing and planned inventory from multiple sources. If there is no visibility across these order pools, there is a good chance that the inventory will be over allocated and lead to out-of-stocks and the possibility of a lost customer. A retailer can compensate for this by having dedicated inventory for each channel, but that will carry a very high cost. Online orders are very small (mostly single unit) and they often come with unique handling requirements such as gift-wrapping. Without the proper technology, it will be very costly to fulfill these small orders while meeting all of the unique requirements.

Fulfilling the orders of the omnichannel customer demands every warehouse, distribution center, and retail location to become a component of a single, tightly integrated, enterprise-wide inventory.

#### Transportation management

Retailers must be ready to deliver to individual homes and businesses around the world, cheaper and faster than ever. Fulfilling orders that originate directly from a customer is a much different proposition than replenishing brick-and-mortar stores. For starters, the order size is very small, often a single unit. Retailers must be more flexible in adapting their transportation strategy and mixing multiple modes—private fleets, third-party carriers, and parcel carriers. Gaining a single view across carriers and having the technology to integrate and manage multiple outsourced relationships will give greater flexibility and agility in balancing speed and cost.

#### Organizational structure

Conflicting priorities and organizational silos remain a key challenge. Traditionally, retailers were organized by departments focused around specific channels, which led to isolated metrics, channel specific financial objectives, varying financial processes, and even leadership differences. Processes that exist in silos are the enemy of cross-channel integration. For instance, retailers should not have different return policies for products bought in store and online. Likewise, a customer stopping in at a physical store to check on an item that was ordered online—and never arrived—should not have to explain what product she ordered.

## Best-in-Class Omnichannel Retailers

Although no retailer has completely mastered the art of omnichannel selling, some retailers are ahead of their peers in adapting omnichannel strategies. Here is a list of top omnichannel retailers, who enable a seamless shopping experience across channels by integrating services, technologies, and processes.

    U.S.: Nordstrom, Apple, Target, Best Buy, Macy’s, Wal-Mart
    U.K.: Mothercare, Debenhams, Marks & Spencer, Boots
    India: Shoppers Stop, Croma

### Nordstrom

Nordstrom, Inc. is an American upscale fashion retailer and is at the forefront of eCommerce and omnichannel retail. Nordstrom has the ‘best-in-class’ omnichannel strategy and execution. It invests heavily into new technologies, processes, and mobile. As a result, its online business grows at 20 percent or more each quarter. Some of its omnichannel initiatives are as follows:

    Inventory visibility. Nordstrom has invested heavily in technology infrastructure to give them inventory visibility. For example, Nordstrom implemented a new function ‘Search & Send’ on its hand-held mobile checkout devices in Nordstrom Rack stores. This function allows salespeople to use mobile registers to search the entire rack inventory for desired items and sizes, and have the items delivered to the customer. Search & Send is available on more than 18,000 devices company-wide.

    Enhanced customer service. Nordstrom has the ability to serve customers across their social media channels, apps, online, and in store. For example, a customer can engage with a Nordstrom representative via Twitter for customer service help and product suggestions.

    Stores as fulfillment centers. Nordstrom has transformed its stores into fulfillment centers and uses its omnichannel tactics to drive foot traffic to its stores. For example, customers can pick up online orders in Nordstrom stores, and can return or exchange online purchases in a physical store.

    Seamless experience. Nordstrom continues to explore new ways to integrate mobile into the online and in-store shopping experience. For example, the retailer integrates mobile devices and QR codes in-store, effectively collecting more contextual data on its customers. This information enables retailers to improve personalization online.

### Macy's

Macy’s is a mid-range chain of department stores owned by American multinational corporation Macy's, Inc. The company began its omnichannel journey in 2009 and is now placing a larger focus on online shopping. Macy’s omnichannel initiatives include investments in improving the website and mobile app to make shopping easier and faster, adopting digital marketing technologies that leverage a 360-degree view of customer shopping behavior, and collaborating on merchandising strategies across all channels. Some of its other omnichannel initiatives are as follows:

    Innovations in in-store technology. Macy’s is piloting a new generation of enhanced hand-held POS devices and tablets to enable sales associates to engage customers more effectively, offer merchandise ideas and product information, and speed transactions. Macy’s is testing Connect@Macy’s Centers in selected locations as in-store destinations for online order pickup, with increased associate staffing to help customers with styling advice and products that meet their needs. In pilot stores, customers also can shop Macy’s omnichannel assortment via electronic kiosks and large interactive ‘lookbook’ displays, and purchase on mobile devices if they prefer.

Connect@Macy’s

    Magic selling. Macy’s is training and coaching associates to improve customer engagements and selling skills. One focus of this strategy is to teach associates to ‘think omnichannel’, which means selling customers merchandise that may not be in the store and embracing customers who are making returns.

    Omnichannel fulfillment. Macy’s has the ability to fulfill online orders both from inventory at warehouses and from stores. Currently, Macy’s has enabled around 500 stores to fulfill online orders. They have built algorithms to determine from where to pull inventory and offer faster delivery, even same-day delivery of online orders.
    Macy’s Wallet. Macy’s has introduced a new mobile wallet. The Macy’s Wallet enables shoppers to easily store and access offers and coupons virtually. The wallet creates a seamless, omnichannel checkout experience for customers enrolled in loyalty rewards programs (Macy’s Star Rewards), whether in store, on the go via their mobile devices, or at home through desktop interaction. Storing this information in a single destination eliminates the need for physical versions of special discount offers or other shopping incentives.
    Shopping apps. Currently, the company integrates a mobile app into the brick-and-mortar shopping experience. The app employs visual recognition technology allowing customers to find product information by scanning items from a catalog or ad. The app is promoted heavily online and integrates text message marketing to enhance customers’ shopping experience. Macy’s is also integrating technologies to predict consumer behavior and customizing content online. Examining customer behavior with analytics and personalization technology will add to the retailer's omnichannel success. Macy’s also continuously encourages shoppers to scan products via their mobile app while shopping in brick-and-mortar stores. Macy’s annual digital plan focuses heavily on mobile and seeks to close the gap between store, desktop, and mobile.


### Wal*Mart



Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., is the world’s largest retailer that operates chains of large discount department stores and warehouse stores. Wal-Mart got into eCommerce more than a decade ago, and to better integrate its stores and eCommerce channels, Wal-Mart has deployed several omnichannel initiatives. These initiatives also drive significant web traffic and improve order conversion rates.

Some of its omnichannel initiatives are as follows:

    Stores as distribution centers. Wal-Mart is turning its stores into mini distribution hubs. Instead of fulfilling online orders from warehouses—hundreds of miles from shoppers’ homes—Wal-Mart is routing orders to stores nearby to speed up shipments. This is called as ‘ship-from-store’ service.

    Pay-with-cash facility. Wal-Mart offers the ‘pay-with-cash’ facility wherein customers can order online from a wide range of merchandise and pay with cash at its stores. This allows the customers, who do not own a credit or a debit card, to buy online, thus boosting online traffic. This service also increases the overall basket size since customers who visit stores to pick up their online orders often end up buying more.

    Personalized customer service. Wal-Mart uses big data to anticipate and respond to shoppers' needs and wants, and to personalize the shopping experience for consumers

    Same-day delivery. Under the same-day delivery program, orders placed on Wal-Mart’s website are directly shipped from its stores and delivered on the same day. More than 5,000 items qualify for same-day delivery and the retailer uses its own trucks to deliver these products.
        ‘Walmart Express’ and ‘Walmart To Go’ stores have the potential to satisfy shopper needs for immediacy for both product purchases and prepared foods.

    Crowd sourcing. To reduce delivery time for most of its online orders, Wal-Mart is exploring the possibilities for ‘crowd sourcing’, wherein store customers are asked to make online deliveries. Since millions of customers visit Wal-Mart stores every week, some of them can sign up to drop off online orders on their way back home. For this service, they will be offered an additional discount on their purchases.

## Card Payments : Security Breaches

Breaches

    Target: 40 million credit and debit cards and personal information of 70 million customers (PIN numbers, social security numbers, address, email IDs) compromised across 1800 stores in 18 days (between November 27 and December 15, 2013 ), costing more than $100 million on investigation, security system upgrades, customer communications, and legal fees.
    Home Depot: 56 million cards compromised across 2000 stores between April and September 2014, costing the retailer $62 million.



Concerns

    Compromised credit card data might be sold underground and counterfeit cards created (card number, billing address, CVV, and expiry date are typically shared by customers with retailers during billing)
    Fabricated debit cards can be used to withdraw cash from ATMs
    Fraudsters will have enough information about someone’s identity (such as their name, date of birth, current or previous addresses) to commit identity fraud. They can:
        Take over existing accounts and also open bank accounts
        Obtain credit cards, loans, and state benefits
        Order goods
        Obtain genuine documents such as passports and driving licenses

Cyber attacks are a major security issue that retailers have to contend with. The consequences of a data breach can be devastating, affecting not just the bottom line but more importantly the customer’s trust. Therefore, there is an increasing pressure on retailers to offer a reliable, convenient, and secure payment method for completing sales.

### Newer Payment Options

1. Digital Wallet
2. Mobile Wallet
3. Others

## In-store digital technologies

### Tablets and kiosks

1. Reduce Checkout queues
2. Create Endless aisles
3. Provide better customer service
4. Enhance in-store experience
5. Reduce the cost of business

### Electronic Shelf Labels


Retailers can use digital displays to make real-time pricing updates as often as needed to match major competitors’ dotcom prices. Prices can be updated based on multiple dimensions such as the time of the day, the customer profile, the store location, market needs and demand, stock, and social reactions. Retailers can also eliminate pricing errors that occur because price tags or shelf labels have not been updated.

Electronic Shelf Labels (ESL) are wireless or digital price tags that display prices (plus additional information such as SKUs and barcodes) using electronic paper display (ePaper) (EPD) or LCD display technology.

### Digital signage and Video Screens

#### Enhance the in-store shopping experience

Live video content is an effective way to engage shoppers; it works by bringing an outside experience into the store and allows shoppers to feel part of the scene on show.

Burberry’s flagship store in London displays streaming videos of Burberry runway shows on giant screens. The fitting room mirrors turn into screens that display information about the garment and videos of models wearing the garment.

#### Guide custoemrs through the store

#### Promote products

#### Increase sales

### Augmented Reality

Augmented reality (AR) has emerged as an innovative tool that helps retailers to blend the digital and physical shopping experience, and interact with consumers on their mobile devices.

1. Increase footfall
2. Visualize products
3. Display product information
4. Try Products virtually

### QR Codes

1. Speed up shopping
2. Facilitate Window Shopping
3. Allow online Shopping
4. Build customer loyalty
5. Allow customer interactions

### Mobile POS

### Wi-Fi

For any of the customer-facing/employee-facing technologies to work, retailers need in-store wireless networks. Retailers such as Tesco are offering free Internet access in stores so that customers can use their mobile or tablet devices to compare prices, read product reviews, and browse deals without any frustrating connection issues.
Wi-Fi access can increase footfall into stores and provide the following benefits to retailers:

    Track customer’s online behavior, including which competitors they are visiting.
    Develop a pool of customer data so the retailer can provide personalized targeting on future visits.
    Allow shoppers to conduct personal activities, which means more time in store and potential impulse to buy.
    Facilitate push applications such as localized targeting of information, discounts, and up-selling to customer’s mobile devices.
    Access to stock availability, freeing up employees' time to spend on more valuable activities such as customer service.
    Deploy tablets and kiosks as interactive catalogs and order systems.



### RFID

Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) relies on a small chip that is embedded in a tag to identify and track individual items, cases, and pallets. The chip can record and store data, such as a serial number, price, or purchase record. The tag can be attached to all sorts of things: merchandise, shipping containers, or vehicles. An electronic scanner that uses radio signals can be used to read or track the ID tag. RFID can also act like a security guard at store entrances and exits.

Use/Examples of RFID in Retail Stores

    Engage customers with the products and the in-store environment. Vanquish, a Japanese clothes retailer, hangs their products from RFID-embedded clothes hangers, which are developed by Tokyo tech firm TeamLab. When a product is lifted off the racks by a customer, the RFID triggers a plasma screen on the wall above the racks, which then displays a sequence of information, images, and video content related to the product selected to help customers with their shopping decisions. The RFID tag can be programmed to change the background music and lighting, or trigger other multimedia devices around the store. The innovation allows retailers to engage customers with the products and the in-store environment.
    Track in-store behavior. RFID technology is also providing a mechanism to track and monitor customer specific information about in-store decision-making and patterns of attraction. Adidas NEO apparel stores use RFID to track the clothes that customers try on, and more importantly, what is left behind on the trial room.
    Trace products throughout the supply chain. Retailers can track products as they move from the manufacturing floor through the supply chain and into the hands of the buyer or consumer. This eases the issue of locating specific products in big warehouses and retail stores.
    Provide store personnel with live updates on inventory. Retailers can gain real-time detailed information on their stock through an on-going automatic scan system in warehouses and stores. This is much more efficient than having an employee manually check inventory on shelves, and could eventually cut costs and improve consumers' experiences in stores, through better stocking and supplies. Wal-Mart, American Apparel Inc., J.C. Penney, Bloomingdale's, and several other retailers uses RFID tags on individual garments that can be read by a hand-held scanner. This ensures that shelves are optimally stocked with the sizes and colors customers want and inventory tightly watched.
    Facilitate speedy checkout. Products with RFID tags need not be scanned separately but can remain placed in the shopping basket as the customer passes through a doorway equipped with appropriate readers. The cashier can view the item details in a few seconds.

Smart shelves

1. Auto replenishment
2. misplace item alert
3. expired date notification
4. item position transparency
5. customer interest notifications
6. additional product information

### NFC


Near Field Communications (NFC) technology allows a smartphone to communicate with other devices or smart tags via radio waves.
Mobile payment services based on NFC technology lets consumers pay for items merely by waving or tapping their smartphones near a checkout counter. The payment data is sent via radio waves from the card to the POS receiver, which then transmits the data via existing payment networks.
Casino, a NFC-enabled French supermarket, allows customers to use their smartphones and the supermarket’s app to scan NFC-enabled shelf labels to access product information such as ingredients, videos, offers, and price. Shoppers can also scan the items placed in their basket into a virtual shopping cart, view the total cost of purchases, and make NFC payments.


### Beacons



Beacons are devices that communicate with a customer’s smartphone while they are in the store. Customers must install the store app in their smartphones to receive messages. Beacons work on Bluetooth technology and are, therefore, able to detect the specific floor or department a customer is in, allowing the store to tailor alerts. It enables retailers and brands to locate, track, communicate, and engage with customers directly in store.

Use/Examples of Beacons in Retail Stores

    Push welcome messages, product information, offers, etc. Retailers use beacons to message consumers while they are in stores—be it welcome greetings, discounts and special offers, product information, branded content, or other alerts. Pushing ads and coupons to customers while they are in the aisles will induce them to buy and help combat showrooming.
    Collect customer data. Retailers use beacons to collect customer data on how they actually move through stores, and analyze their browsing habits and shopping patterns. This will help retailers better segment their audiences and advertise accordingly.


## Evolving role of Stores

Physical stores will continue to influence volume and revenue, attract customers, and build brand loyalty across channels and product categories. While retailers need to continue to provide customers the ability to shop where and when they want, it is equally important to make the store the place people want to shop. In this context, retailers are strategically assessing and recasting the role of their stores with the following five dimensions in mind.

### Discovery

Stores are natural venues in which consumers can learn more about products, try them out, and hunt for hidden treasures. Building up this role will attract customers on the 'occasion trips' who fall into the higher-than-planned spending group. The discovery dimension increases value across channels, as shoppers may come to the store to try out a product found online, or buy a product in the store and make repeat purchases online.

### Entertainment

Retailers should provide an exciting in-store environment that engages shoppers. A more entertainment-focused venue also builds longer-term engagement with the retail brand and the lifestyle it represents. The products are less likely to be viewed as commodities that can be purchased at the lowest price across channels.

### Relationship

The store is the ideal place to provide personalized service—before, during, and after the sale—that can be an incentive to not only frequent the store channel, but also spend more money there. Forming a positive relationship with customers builds crucial and sustainable brand loyalty that improves performance across all channels.

### Transaction

Stores remain the overwhelming choice for sealing the deal regardless of delivery method. A convenient, enjoyable transaction through fast moving checkout lines and service-oriented cashiers, for example, can help build brand loyalty. The point of sale also affords an opportunity to boost profits by upselling or offering value-added services such as extended warranties.

### Fulfillment

With customers looking at innovative delivery options, online retailers can no longer afford to be just ‘pure play online’. Even colossal Internet players are exploring to have an offline presence. Unlike online retailers who may have to strive hard for physical store presence, brick-and-mortar retailers don’t have to struggle as much—the latter can double up as fulfillment centers for cross channel orders, allowing customers to purchase online and pick up items from the store.
For example, Amazon is forging partnerships with local establishments to set up an Amazon Locker on their premises that allows customers to pick up or return shipments at their own convenient time, rather than wait for deliveries at home or at the workplace. This adds convenience for the customer and reduces delivery costs for the retailer. Major retailers like Best Buy and Macy’s are taking advantage of their physical presence by turning their hundreds of locations into mini warehouses and fulfillment centers.


## Innovations in Retail

### IoT

The Internet of Things (IoT) connects people, machines, items, and services to streamline the flow of information, enable real-time decisions, and heighten consumer experiences. It facilitates efficient retail operations through the integration of sensors, smartphone apps, and back-end automation. The following are some areas where retailers can benefit from IoT:

1. Inventory Management
2. Fleet Management
3. Maintenance and Warranty
4. Realtime promotions
5. Next gen vending machines

### Wearables

1. Collect granular data : Because wearable devices are physically attached to consumers, they help retailers collect granular data on shoppers, such as in-store shopping frequency, basket size, dollar value per item, length of stay, and dwell times. Retailers should leverage this information to optimize in-store operations such as inventory planning and product placement, and to improve sales.
2. Workforce Optimization : Store associates wearing smart tags can be tracked by the store manager based on their location, workload, and tasks assigned. Associates can also get real-time notifications, paging, and deployment alerts based on other activities happening in the store.
3. Planogram Compliance : Devices such as Google Glass can help store associates access a planogram to see the correct store layout, check on-shelf availability, and provide customers with information on other SKUs, the benefits of specific products, or even review ratings.

### Fast-Checkout
Real customer empowerment lies in liberating customers from long queues at the checkout. mPOS, customer POS (CPOS), robotic shopping carts, and 'Scan and Go' solutions are already shifting the checkout from tills to anywhere on the sales floor. In the future, POS terminals may pave the way for an invisible array of network sensors, RFIDs, image processors, and customer devices, enabling a ‘no stop’ checkout and making ‘walk in, pick item, and walk out’ a reality.

2. Scan and Go
3. High-speed checkout tunnels

### Drones and Robots

Though retailers, such as Amazon, Target, and Home Depot, have made it easy to browse and buy online, the process of delivering all those goods to consumers remain as cumbersome as ever. The problem is becoming more complicated as retailers, in a bid to win customers, promise free shipping or same-day shipping. To lead in the logistics race, retailers are investing in technology to reduce order costs, speed delivery, and drive higher operating efficiency within warehouses, where humans—and human error—still rule the day. This has led to the use of robots, drones, and driverless cars for retail operations and to deliver goods commercially.

#### Drones

In December 2013, Amazon unveiled its new home delivery system ‘Amazon Prime Air’. The goal of this system is to replace postmen and deliver orders into customers' hands in 30 minutes or less using unmanned aerial vehicles called 'octopters'. These drones are unmanned and use GPS tracking to find their way to and from the delivery address. The drones would ship orders under five pounds (2.3 kg) to customers within a 10 mile (16 km) radius of Amazon’s fulfillment centers in 30 minutes.
Amazon plans to implement the ‘Amazon Prime Air’ service as soon as the US Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) grants permission. Currently, there are government regulations that prohibit any aircraft to fly autonomously, without anyone at the controls. Once authorized, these drones will have a major impact on how retailers deliver online orders.

#### Robots


Retailers, such as Amazon, Zappos and Walgreens, use robots in their warehouses to increase productivity and reduce utility costs and personnel costs. The robots can shuttle shelves full of merchandise to warehouse workers, relieving the workers of having to dash throughout the warehouse. They help complete up to 30,000 online orders at logistics every day.

These robots are connected to the inventory software and knew where to go to pick up the items and where to deliver them inside the fulfillment center. They receive their orders wirelessly, use cameras to read navigational QR code stickers on the warehouse floor, slide under and move racks of inventory along a floor grid, and automatically move merchandise to warehouse workers.

When a customer places an online order, a robot automatically wheels into a grid of shelves, locates the right shelf, lifts it onto its back, and carries it to a picking station, where human workers take what is needed, pack it, and ship it.


#### 3D printing

Retailers, such as Wal-Mart and Staples, are offering a 3D imaging and printing service in their stores. 3D printing enables retailers to create and deliver custom-made products in small quantities in real time. This helps to cut costs in manufacturing, reduce supply chain costs, and provide actionable insight into which products will actually drive demand. For example, if a 3D model is well received, it can then be mass produced through traditional manufacturing channels to meet higher demand. On the other hand, customers can buy custom-made products that are not present online, and get it delivered to their home.
