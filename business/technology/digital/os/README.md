What is an Operating System?

An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.

### Components

- Kernel
- Process Management Module
- Memory(RAM) Management Modules
- File System
- Device Drivers
- User Interface

### Goals

- Efficiency
- User Convenience
- Security and Protection
- Multitasking and Parallel Processing
- Reliability and Fault tolerance

### Functions

1. Process Management: Creation, Scheduling, and termination of process
2. Memory Management: Allocation of memory to process in need for it, and freeing when no longer required. Implement Virtual memory, for using secondary storage as extended RAM
3. File systems management: Managing files on disk
4. Device Management: Abstract hardware devices, for use with software.
5. Security and Access Control: User authentication and protection against unauthorized entry
6. Networking
7. User Interface
