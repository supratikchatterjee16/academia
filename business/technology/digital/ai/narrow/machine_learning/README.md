## Supervised Learning

We enter a set of inputs and outputs, to help a program generalize it, using a best fit line/function. This is then used to predict outputs for related value.

For example :

| Input | Output |
| :---: | :----: |
|     1 |      1 |
|     2 |      4 |
|     3 |      9 |
|     4 |     16 |
|     . |      . |
|     . |      . |
|     . |      . |
|    10 |      ? |

This is **approximation**.

## Unsupervised learning

No labeled data.

Density estimation is used here.

This is **description**.
