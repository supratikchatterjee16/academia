# High Powered Computing

This is the set of processes involved in accelerating computation processes, through distribution and parallelization of the kernels.

NVIDIA is a major player in this market.

## Design Practice

### CUDA

For CUDA, NVIDIA suggests making use of the APOD design cycle.
Which are : 

1. Assess
2. Parallelize
3. Optimize
4. Deploy
