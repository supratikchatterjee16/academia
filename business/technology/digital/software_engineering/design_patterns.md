# Design Patterns

Made up of OOP omponents of :

1. Encapsulation
2. Inheritance
3. Abstraction
4. Polymorphism

Ths originated in 1977 by Cristopher Alexander. Augmented in 1987 by Beck and Cunningham.

Gained popularity in 1994 when GoF published a book calle "Design Patterns : Elements of Reusable Oject Oriented Software".

Keep low coupling and high cohesion.

It can be data or procedure coupling.

It is needed to :

- Describe issues r problems occuringg repeatedly in our environment
- Describe solutions for the problems
- The solutions are reusable without having to reinvent the wheel

## Defining

Design patterns can e deine as solution to common reoccuring problems or templates for defining approaches of solving problems.

It should be defined using : 

1. Patterns' name
2. Problems
3. Solutions
4. Outcomes and consequences of solutions
5. Implementation with UML artifacts

## OOAD Principles behind Design Patterns

1. SOLID.
    - Prefer composition over inheritance
    - Program to interace rather than implement.

## In Practice

There are the following patterns :

1. Architectural Patterns : Broad-based design problems solved using strutural approach
2. Data Patterns : Describes data oriented problems and data models as solutions
3. Interface Design Patterns : Describes comon UI problems and solutions
4. Integration Patterns : Identifies integration issues an solutions aroun it
5. WebApp Patterns : Address problems encountered while building web application

Patterns :

1. Pub-Sub
2. Polling
3. Translator
4. Content Enricher
5. Endpoint
6. Dispatcher
7. Router
8. Header Enriher
9. Store
10. Splittter
11. Aggregator
12. Resequencer

## Description : Documenting a design pattern

It defines desin patterns and documents it.

Description elements :

1. Pattern Name
2. Intent or objective
3. Alias
4. Motivation
5. Applicability
6. Participants
7. Collaborations
8. Consequences
9. Sample Code
10. Known users
11. Related patterns
12. Structure

Visually these can be depiced using UML diagrams. Specifically, class, sequence, associaion and state diagrams.

Major points :

- Empty diamond is for aggregation. Component can exist without the origin object. Ex : Items inside a warehouse
- Filled diamond is for composition. Component cannot exist without the origin object. Ex : Engine in a car
- Empty arrows can represent generalization or realizations
- Other relations are association and dependeny

This is a catalog of patterns to choose from for OOAD.
