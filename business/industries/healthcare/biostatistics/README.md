## Phases of Clinical Research

1. Phase 0 : Pharmacodynamics and Pharmacokinetics particularly oral availability and half-life of the drug. 10 patients tested for sub-therapeutic effect. Very short months
2. Phase 1 : Testing of drug on healthy volunteers for dose-ranging. 20-100 patients for Safety and dosage. Several months
3. Phase 2 : Testing of drug on patients to assess efficacy and safety. 100 - 300 patients for efficacy and side effects. Several months to 2 years
4. Phase 3 : Testing on patients to assess efficacy, effectiveness and safety. 300-3000 patients tested for efficacy and adverse reactions. Takes 1 - 4 years
5. Phase 4 : Post-marketing surveillance, watching drug use in public, commitment trials and label updates. Several thousands tasted for safety and efficacy in wider population in a non-regulated environment. Long term.
