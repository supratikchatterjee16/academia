rate in order to not lose value.

FD is also a bond, but a loss making bond.
In saving account it is 3% and in FD it is 5%.
Inflation at the point of this writeup is 8% ~ 11%.

Liquid Debt funds are profitable, but important to invest in companies with high trust.

### Equities

Need to have knowhow.

Equity, typically referred to as shareholders' equity (or owners' equity for privately held companies), represents the amount of money that would be returned to a company's shareholders if all of the assets were liquidated and all of the company's debt was paid off in the case of liquidation.
