# Test Driven Development

Has 3 phases :

1. Red phase : Think about what to develop
    - Think about behaviour
    - Write the test cases
2. Green Phase : How to make the tests pass
    - Write just enough code to make the test pass
    - Create simplest implementation possible
3. Refactor phase : Think about making improvements
    - Modify code to improve
    - Continues till all tests passed
    - The code should be readable and all duplications should be eliminated
