# Digital Product Development

**Digital Product Development** is the process of **planning, designing, building, testing, launching, and improving** a product that exists in digital form. These products are created to solve user problems, provide value, and typically operate through software and connected systems.

Digital products include things people **use**, **interact with**, or **access digitally**, such as:

* Mobile apps (e.g., WhatsApp, Duolingo)
* Websites & web apps (e.g., Amazon, Gmail)
* SaaS platforms (e.g., Salesforce, Slack)
* Digital tools, marketplaces, and portals
* AI and data-driven products (e.g., recommendation systems)

---

## **Key Goals of Digital Product Development**

* Understand user needs and pain points
* Convert ideas into functional product experiences
* Continuously improve based on feedback and data
* Deliver value that is scalable, usable, and sustainable
