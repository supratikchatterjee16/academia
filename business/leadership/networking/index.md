"People need People"

"If I have see a little further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants" - Isaac Newtown  
"You are not ever a genius by yourself. Your ideas are a function of the people you are connected with.." - Carol Dweck, Author, Mindset  

Knowing more people gives you : 

1. Greater Access
2. Facilitates sharing of Information
3. Widens your influence
4. Enhances confidence levels

Access to private information which can be made use of : 

1. Referrals
2. Appropriate name-dropping
3. Number of people willing to help you
4. Access to resources
5. Emotional Support
6. Gets you strategic influence

Networking for introverts :

1. Like Me - Self-Similarity
2. Near Me - Proximity
3. Width and Depth - Bridging and Bonding

Most time is spent with : 

1. People in the department
2. People in the same floor
3. People in the same location

The wrong structures : 

1. The formalist - no informal connections
2. The overloaded executive - wants to connect wih everyone, resulting in becoming a bottleneck to progress and burn out.

The wrong relationships : 

1. The disconnected expert - works with safe set of expertises and do not get out of their confort zone
2. The biased executive - relies on advisers much like herself, who reinforce their own bias

The wrong behaviour : 

1. The chameleons - people who adjust their opinions to connect with others
2. The superficial networker - Say hi to most people, without having any deep connections 


Exercise for analyzing oneself : 

Ratte  yourslef on the following topics, with 1 being dows not describe me well at all" and 5 being "Describes me very well" : 

| Topic | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| I have many friends | | | * | |
| I make friends easily | | * | | |
| I like to have many friends | | | * | | |
| I have many acquaintances | | | | * | |

| I put people in touch with the right people when they need something | | | | * | |
| I find it easier to bring people together | | * | | | |
| I like being able to connect people | | | | * | |

Items 1 - 3 are about making friends  
Items 4 - 6 are about making acquaintances
Items 7 - 9 are about connecting people

Adding the values of each rating.

Friends : 3 + 2 + 3 = 8  
Acquaintances : 4 + 4 + 4 = 12  
Connecting People : 4 + 2 + 4 = 10
