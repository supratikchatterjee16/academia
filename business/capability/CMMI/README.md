# Capability Maturity Model Integration

- Reference : [CMMI for Development: Implementation guide by Mukund Chaudhary, Abhishek Chopra](https://accenture.percipio.com/books/da2c8fd0-2495-11e7-9772-0242c0a80506#epubcfi(/6/8!/4/2%5Bepubmain%5D/2%5Bch001_s1_1%5D/2/2/1:0))

CMMI is about collecting the characterisitics of affective processes, ad then using this information to provide guidance for improving an organization's processes. The end goal is to make it easier for an organization to develop products or solutions by improving it's ability to manage development, acquisition, and maintenance of it's product or services.

CMMI is a model; it tells us what to do, but not how to do it.It is a concept we nee to apply to the oganization to get mture from a process perspective.

> The Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) is a capability improvement model that can be adapted to solve any performance issue at any level of the organization in any industry. The Model provides guidelines and recommendations for helping your organization diagnose problems and improve performance. Used by over 5000 organizations in more than 70 countries all over the world, CMMI helps you identify and achieve measurable business goals. - CMMI Institute

CMMI currently addresses three important areas of interest:
- Product and Service deelopmen - CMMI for Development(CMMI-DEV)    
- Service Establishment, management - CMMI for Services(CMMI-SVC)
- Product and service acquisition - CMI for Acquisition(CMMI-ACQ)

Business objectives in CMMI

- deliver products within budget and on time
- Improve productivity by a specified percent in a specified timeframe
- Maintain customer satisfaction ratings
- Improve time-to-market for new products or servuce releases by a specified percent in a specified time
- reduce the rate of product recalls by a specified percent in a specified timeframe
- decrease the cost of maintaining legacy products by a specified percent in a specified timeframe

The term maturity refers to improving our process on a continual basis, in the context of CMMI.

Developed by Humphrey and Software Engineering Institute, at the request of DoD and USAF.

## CMMI Is Used for Process Improvement

To cater to comprehensive business process improvements, CMMI features 25 different process areas. Each process area is composed of two kinds of goals (generic goal and specific goal) and two kinds of practices. There is also a lot of information for helping management to develop strategies.

In CMMI, there are three constellations to help improve a given business need, which are listed as follows:

- Development: For improving the development of solutions
- Acquisition: For improving the purchasing of products, services, and/or solutions
- Services: For improving the delivery of services and the creation of service systems to operate a solution


## CMMI Design


CMMI stands for Capability Maturity Model Integration.

- Capability: When we want to implement and achieve a process improvement in an individual process area
- Maturity: When we want to implement and achieve process improvement in a set of process areas which are predefined
- Model: Generated from the CMMI Framework
- Integration: This approach uses a combination of selected models that are integrated into a single framework.

### CMMI Levels

- Level 0 - Incomplete
- Level 1 - Performed
- Level 2 - Managed
- Level 3 - Defined

## Process Areas

Process areas are viewed differently in Continuous and staged representations.

In continuous representation, process areas:

- Process management
- project management
- Engineering
- Support

When process areas are selected for implementation, check and analyze the maturity level to be attained for the process area (i.e., select the appropriate capability level).

Once an organization achieves a capability level, it should always target achieving the next capability level in the same process areas or target a larger number of process areas.

So, how should an organization select process areas combined with their required capability levels?

This is described in a target profile, which defines the process areas that need to be addressed and the capability levels targeted for each. It also describes the goals and practices the organization will have to address in its process-improvement efforts.

In staged representation, process areas are grouped into maturity levels that indicate which process areas will be implemented to achieve each maturity level.

For example, at maturity level 2, a predefined set of process areas might require an organization to achieve all the goals of all the process areas.

Once maturity level 2 is achieved, the organization's focus should be on achieving maturity level 3 process areas, and so on.

Generic goals present in each process area are predefined. Generic goal 2 is applicable to maturity level 2, and generic goal 3 is applicable to maturity levels 3 through 5.

Process areas are assigned into the following categories:

Project Management (seven total process areas)

- Project planning (PP)
- Integrated project management (IPM)
- Project monitoring and control (PMC)
- Requirements management (REQM)
- Risk management (RSKM)
- Supplier agreement management (SAM)
- Quantitative project management (QPM)

Engineering (Five Total Process Areas)

- Requirements development (RD)
- Technical solution (TS)
- Product integration (PI)
- Validation (VAL)
- Verification (VER)

Process management (five total process areas)

- Organizational performance management (OPM)
- Organizational process definition (OPD)
- Organizational process focus (OPF)
- Organizational process performance (OPP)
- Organizational training (OT)

Note	
All of the process management process areas start with Organizational.

Support (five total process areas)

- Causal analysis and resolution (CAR)
- Configuration management (CM)
- Decision analysis and resolution (DAR)
- Measurement and analysis (MA)
- Process and product quality assurance (PPQA)
