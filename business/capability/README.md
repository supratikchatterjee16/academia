# Capabilities in Businesses

**Business capabilities** are the core abilities or capacities that an organization needs to **achieve its objectives**, **deliver value**, and **operate effectively**.

They are **what** a business does (its intrinsic abilities), not **how** it does it (processes, people, or systems).

---

### Definition

> A **business capability** represents what the organization is able to do — regardless of how, where, or by whom it is executed.

### Key Characteristics of Business Capabilities

| Feature                           | Description                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Stable over time**              | Unlike processes or technologies, capabilities are relatively stable even as tools and org structures change.                  |
| **Independent of implementation** | Describes the *what*, not the *how*. E.g., "Customer Management" is a capability; CRM software is a tool used to implement it. |
| **Outcome-focused**               | Tied to delivering value, achieving outcomes, and enabling strategy.                                                           |
| **Modular and hierarchical**      | Capabilities can be broken down into sub-capabilities. For example: "Marketing" → "Digital Marketing" → "SEO Management".      |

### Examples of Common Business Capabilities

| Domain            | Capability                                        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Sales & Marketing | Customer Relationship Management, Lead Generation |
| Finance           | Budgeting, Financial Reporting                    |
| HR                | Talent Acquisition, Workforce Planning            |
| IT                | IT Service Management, Data Management            |
| Operations        | Supply Chain Management, Inventory Control        |

### Why Business Capabilities Matter

* **Strategic Planning**: Helps executives align investments with business strategy.
* **Gap Analysis**: Identifies weak or missing capabilities needed to compete or transform.
* **Digital Transformation**: Enables organizations to focus on *what* needs to change, independent of current systems.
* **Mergers & Acquisitions**: Helps in assessing overlap or gaps across organizations.
* **Enterprise Architecture**: Forms the foundation for capability-based planning and roadmaps.

### Business Capability vs Business Process

| Business Capability      | Business Process            |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| **What** a business does | **How** it does it          |
| Stable over time         | May change frequently       |
| Abstract, strategic view | Concrete, operational view  |
| "Order Fulfillment"      | "Pick, pack, ship an order" |

### Business Capability Models

Organizations often visualize capabilities in **capability maps** (e.g., boxes grouped into categories). These maps:

* Support maturity assessments
* Inform technology investment
* Enable strategic discussions between business and IT

---


### 1. General Business Capability and Maturity Frameworks

#### Capability Maturity Model Integration

* **Focus**: Engineering, Software
* **Use Case**: Process Improvement

#### COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies)

* **Focus**: IT governance and management.
* **Similarity**: Provides maturity models and capability assessments similar to CMMI.
* **Use Case**: Aligns IT with business goals, manages risk, and ensures value delivery.

#### Business Process Maturity Model (BPMM)

* **Developed by**: Object Management Group (OMG).
* **Focus**: Organizational business processes.
* **Similarity**: Structured in levels like CMMI, from Initial (ad hoc) to Optimizing.
* **Use Case**: Process improvement, operational efficiency.

#### PCF (Process Classification Framework) by APQC

* **Focus**: Business process benchmarking and management.
* **Similarity**: Organizes business capabilities and processes but less prescriptive than CMMI.
* **Use Case**: Capability modeling, benchmarking against industry peers.

#### Baldrige Performance Excellence Framework

* **Focus**: Organizational performance across leadership, strategy, customers, operations, and results.
* **Similarity**: Encourages continuous improvement with maturity assessments.
* **Use Case**: Holistic business excellence.

---

### 2. Software and Systems Engineering

#### ISO/IEC 330xx (SPICE – Software Process Improvement and Capability dEtermination)

* **Focus**: Software process capability and maturity.
* **Similarity**: Very similar in structure to CMMI, based on capability levels.
* **Use Case**: Software development process improvement, often used in automotive and aerospace.

#### SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework) – Business Agility Maturity Model

* **Focus**: Agile maturity across the enterprise.
* **Similarity**: Provides maturity assessments and capability maps for agility across functions.
* **Use Case**: Agile transformation, lean portfolio management.

---

### 3. Enterprise Architecture / Capability Planning

#### TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework) Capability Maturity Model

* **Focus**: Enterprise architecture capability.
* **Similarity**: Has its own maturity model for architectural practices.
* **Use Case**: EA development and governance.

#### Gartner’s Business Capability Model

* **Focus**: Mapping what a business does, independently of how or where it's done.
* **Similarity**: Focuses on capabilities rather than processes, often used with maturity models.
* **Use Case**: Strategic planning, IT alignment, capability-based planning.

---

### 4. Industry-Specific Capability Models

* **eSCM (eSourcing Capability Model)** – For sourcing and IT-enabled services.
* **eTOM (Enhanced Telecom Operations Map)** – For telecom service providers.
* **SCOR (Supply Chain Operations Reference Model)** – For supply chain performance and capability.
