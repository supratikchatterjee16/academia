# Enterprise Architecture

Enterprise Architecture is in the context of a complete enterprise that consists of :

- Business processes
- Information
- Technology
- Infrastructure

it can also include :

1. Partners
2. Suppliers
3. Customers
4. Stakeholders

A business strategy determines how a business will operate in the future. It's purpose is to :
- Align and prepare to operate when that time comes
- Includes all areas of the business

Inclde all manual processes that may be present.

Enterprise Architecture is not exclusively an IT function
- Tools used for business transformation

Can take years to have an ROI if implemented properly.

Could be the difference in business success/failure

provides advantages for both business and IT sides :
- reduces costs
- reduces complexity
- maximizes IT investments

Senior management support is required.
- CEO/CIO buy ins required
- Without support it becomes difficult to balance
    - Business innovation
    - IT efficiency
    - Process Automation

Enterprise architects should have an appropriate high level of IT expertise.

It makes it easier to describe business.

Framework is the structure designed to support or enclose something else.

Helps achieves standardization in terms of :

- Approach
- Terminology
- Methodology
- Understanding
- Sharing

TOGAF is developed by a global consortium developedi in 1995 by hundreds of member organisation.

Other Frameworks :

- NIST
- Zachman

Architecture Framework
- Foundational structure
- Contains a common set of tools and vocabulary
- Lists recommended compliant products and standards
- Business Transformation

Open or Flow System
- Information Exchange between systems

## TOGAF - An Introduction

"Boundaryless Information Flow" is what it intends to help achieve.
- Deliver required information
- to the appropriate people
- understandable manner
- timely fashion

It is made up of the Architecture Development Methods(ADM), which contains guidelines and techniques that:
- Describe how to produce architectural components
- Information regarding practical application of ADM

It also has the Architecture Content Framework, which helps describe a structure for storing all architectural documents, as well as other outputs from ADM and enables reuse of architectural components.

Also includes Architectural Capability Framework which describes building up and maintaining enterprise architectural pracitces.

Also includes Enterprise Continuum and Tools section, which describes the categorization and storage of outputs.

### Architecture Types in TOGAF

Types of Domains :
- Business
- Data
- Application
- Technology


Business Architecture consists of :
- Business Startegy that describes a paln of action
- Organization
- Governance containing policies, monitoring, and procedures
- Key business processes

Data Architecture
- Describes organizational structure using data assets(logical and physical)
- Lists management resources

Application Architecture
- Outlines deployment of individual applications
    - subsequent interactions
    - relationships to core business functions

Technology Architecture
- Outlines requirements to support deployment
    - Business
    - Data
    - Applications
- Includes
    - Processing
    - Standards
    - Communication
    - Infrastructure

### Architecture Development Method(ADM)

Provides tested and repeatable process that can be used for developing architectures.
Establishes an architecture framework.
Develops architecture content.
Helps in transitioning and governance.

Preliminary phase :
- Preparation
- Initial activities required to create Architecture Capability

Phase A : Architecture Bision
- Describes initial stages of architecture development cycle
- Contains initiative, indentified stakeholders, vision and approval

Phase B : Business Architecture
- Development of architecture to support the agreed-upon vision

Phase C : Information Systems Architecture
- Development of Information Systems Architectures to support the agreed-upon vision

Phase D : Technology Architecture
- Development of Tech Archiitecture based on vision

Phase E : Opportunities and Solutions/Implementation Architecture
- Process of indetifying delivery vehicles in the form of projects, program and portfolios

Phase F: Migration Planning
- describes process of moving from baseline to target architectures

Phase G : Implementation Governance
- Provides architectural oversight of implementation

Phase H : Architecture Change Management
- ensure changes to the architecture are implemented properly

Requirements Management
- Ensures changes to requirements are handled properly

#### Outputs to methods

Types :
- Deliverables
    - Work product required at the end of a project.
    - Contractually specified
    - Stakeholders need to review, agree and sign off
    - Represents the output of a project in a documented form
- Artifacts
    - Document related to architectural components, containing the architectural work products
    - Describes aspects of architecture
    - Classifications into catalogs, matrices and diagrams
- Building Blocks
    - Reusable artifacts
    - Outlines components that can potentially be reused
        - Business
        - IT
        - Architectural
    - Architecture Building Blocks(ABBs)
        - Describes requirements of SBBs
    - Solution Building Blocks(SBBs)
        - Represents components used to implement required capability

#### Architecture Repository and Enterprise Continuum

Architecture repository is one part of the wider Enterprise Repository
- Provides capability to link architectural assets to components
    - Detailed Design
    - Deployment
    - Service Management Repositories
- Architecture Continuum and Solutions Continuum as parts of the Enterprise Continuum
- Created by ADM

Architecture Meta Model
- Describes application of an architecture framework

Architecture Capability
- Parameters
- Structures
- Processes

Architecture Landscape
- representation of assets
- Exists at multiple levels of abstraction

Standards Information Base
- Captures standards which new architectures must comply with
    - Industry
    - Products
    - Services

Reference Library

Governance Log


#### Enterprise Acrhitecture Capability

- Business capability for architecture
    - Organzation structures
    - Roles
    - Resposibilities
    - Skills
    - Processes

What needs to be looked into for it : 

- Financial Management
- Performance Management
- Service Management
- Service Management
- Risk Management
- Resource Management
- Communicationss and Stakeholder Management
- Quality Management
- Supplier Management
- Configuration/Environment Management

Governance needs to be well-defined/effective, should have a single framework, increasingly visible and aligns with the best practices.
