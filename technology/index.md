# Technology

Technology refers to the application of scientific knowledge and tools to solve practical problems and achieve specific goals. It encompasses a wide range of techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in the creation, development, and utilization of goods and services. Technology can be broadly categorized into different types, including information technology, communication technology, medical technology, and industrial technology, among others.

In a more general sense, technology can also refer to the sum of the ways in which social groups provide themselves with the material objects of their civilization. It includes not only physical devices and machines but also the knowledge, processes, and systems that are used to create and operate them.

The rapid advancements in technology have played a crucial role in shaping the modern world, affecting various aspects of human life, such as communication, transportation, healthcare, entertainment, and education. Technologies can range from simple tools and machines to complex systems and networks, and they continue to evolve, driving innovation and influencing the way people live and work.

There are 2 classification systems relevant:

- North American Classification System(NAICS) - classifies industries
- International Stadard Classification of Education(ISCED) - classifies fields of education or training

## ISCED-F 2013

[ISCED](https://uis.unesco.org/en/topic/international-standard-classification-education-isced) organizes the fields hierarchically into:

1. Broad fields(Represented by 2 digits)
2. Narrow fields(Represented by 3 digits)
3. Detailed fields(4 digits)

For instance, "Engineering, Manufacturing and Construction" is "07", under which "Engineering and Engineering Trades" have the code "071" and "Electronics and Automation" has the code "0714".

A list of ISCED broad fields are:

| Code   | Broad Field                                       |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **00** | Generic programmes and qualifications             |
| **01** | Education                                         |
| **02** | Arts and humanities                               |
| **03** | Social sciences, journalism and information       |
| **04** | Business, administration and law                  |
| **05** | Natural sciences, mathematics and statistics      |
| **06** | Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) |
| **07** | Engineering, manufacturing and construction       |
| **08** | Agriculture, forestry, fisheries and veterinary   |
| **09** | Health and welfare                                |
| **10** | Services                                          |

The fields can be classified in different ways, but adherence to a standardization process, provides extensibility, hence we will be adhering to the aforementioned standard.

## NAICS

[NAICS](https://www.census.gov/naics/) uses a 6 digit hierarchcal code structure, to divide industrial sectors:

| Digit(s) | Meaning                                            |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 1st–2nd  | Economic sector (e.g., Manufacturing, Information) |
| 3rd      | Subsector                                          |
| 4th      | Industry group                                     |
| 5th      | NAICS industry                                     |
| 6th      | Country-specific industry (if needed)              |

A list of the NAICS broad sectors are:

## Organization of information here

Our focus here, under technology will be primarily the ISCED codes **05, 06, 07, & 08**, these will be mapped into the NAICS codes as required, under the "industries" section, some of the constructs of 05(Natural Sciences, Mathematics, and Statistics), will, when relevant be attached to the business and other technology sections, as the field's parlance.

## Classifications based on digitization

Technology can be broadly classified into digital and non-digital categories based on the nature of the underlying processes and information representation.

1. **Digital Technology:**
   - **Binary Representation:** Digital technology operates using binary code, represented by combinations of 0s and 1s.
   - **Processing of Digital Signals:** Digital systems process information using discrete values and precise mathematical calculations.
   - **Examples:** Computers, smartphones, digital cameras, digital audio players, digital watches, and digital televisions.

2. **Non-Digital (Analog) Technology:**
   - **Continuous Representation:** Analog technology operates using continuous signals and values within a range.
   - **Processing of Analog Signals:** Analog systems process information using continuously varying physical quantities such as voltage or electrical currents.
   - **Examples:** Analog watches, analog audio recording devices (e.g., cassette tapes, vinyl records), analog thermometers, and analog television (though digital TV has largely replaced analog TV in many regions).

It's worth noting that there can be instances where both digital and analog components are used together, and the distinction between them is not always absolute. For example, hybrid systems may use digital components for processing and communication while interacting with analog sensors or devices.

In recent times, there has been a significant shift towards digital technology due to its advantages in terms of precision, reliability, and the ability to process and transmit data more efficiently. Many traditional analog technologies have been replaced or complemented by their digital counterparts as technology continues to evolve. -->
