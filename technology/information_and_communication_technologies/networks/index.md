# Networks

In **Information Technology (IT)**, **networks** are defined as:

---

### Definition

> A **network** is a collection of interconnected devices (such as computers, servers, routers, and switches) that **communicate and exchange data** using a common set of protocols over wired or wireless connections.

### Key Concepts in IT Networks:

1. **Nodes**
   Devices on the network (e.g., computers, printers, mobile devices, servers).

2. **Links**
   Communication pathways—either **wired** (Ethernet, fiber) or **wireless** (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth).

3. **Protocols**
   Rules governing data communication (e.g., **TCP/IP**, **HTTP**, **FTP**, **DNS**).

4. **Topology**
   The layout of how devices are connected:

   * **Star**, **Bus**, **Ring**, **Mesh**, etc.

5. **Types of Networks:**

   * **LAN (Local Area Network):** A network in a limited area (e.g., home, office).
   * **WAN (Wide Area Network):** Covers large geographical areas (e.g., the Internet).
   * **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):** Spans a city or large campus.
   * **PAN (Personal Area Network):** Small range (e.g., Bluetooth devices).
   * **WLAN (Wireless LAN):** A LAN using wireless connections.

6. **Network Devices:**

   * **Router:** Directs data between networks (e.g., home to Internet).
   * **Switch:** Connects devices within a LAN.
   * **Firewall:** Controls traffic based on security rules.
   * **Access Point:** Allows wireless devices to join a wired network.

7. **Network Services:**

   * **IP addressing**
   * **DNS (Domain Name System)**
   * **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**
   * **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**
