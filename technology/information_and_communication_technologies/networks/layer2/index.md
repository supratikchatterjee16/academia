# Data Link Layer(OSI Layer 2)

The Data Link Layer is responsible for reliable node-to-node data transfer. It takes raw bits from the Physical Layer (Layer 1) and organizes them into frames, ensuring that data is transferred error-free and in the correct order over a physical link between two directly connected nodes.

### Key Responsibilities

1. **Framing**

   * Breaks up data from the Network Layer (Layer 3) into manageable units called **frames**.
   * Adds headers and trailers for synchronization and control.

2. **Physical Addressing**

   * Uses **MAC (Media Access Control) addresses** to identify devices on a local network.
   * These are hardware addresses burned into network interface cards (NICs).

3. **Error Detection and Handling**

   * Implements error detection methods like **CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check)**, often using **CRC32**.
   * Can **detect** errors, but usually doesn't correct them (except in some cases like in PPP with FEC).

4. **Flow Control**

   * Ensures that the sender doesn't overwhelm the receiver with too much data.
   * Simple forms can be implemented in this layer (more complex flow control is typically at Layer 4).

5. **Access Control**

   * Determines how devices share the communication medium (e.g., Ethernet's CSMA/CD, Wi-Fi’s CSMA/CA).
   * Helps prevent collisions in shared medium networks.

6. **Medium Access Control (MAC) and Logical Link Control (LLC)**

   * The layer is divided into **two sublayers**:

     * **MAC Sublayer**: Deals with physical addressing and access to the physical medium.
     * **LLC Sublayer**: Manages communication between the Data Link Layer and Network Layer.

### Frame Structure (Example: Ethernet Frame)

```
+-------------+-----------+----------+-------------+--------------+
| Preamble    | MAC Addr. | Type     | Payload     | CRC (FCS)    |
| (7 bytes)   | (Source & | (2 bytes)| (Data)      | (4 bytes)    |
|             | Dest)     |          |             |              |
+-------------+-----------+----------+-------------+--------------+
```

### Devices Operating at Layer 2

* **Switches** (learn and forward based on MAC addresses)
* **Bridges**
* **Network Interface Cards (NICs)**

> **Note**: Switches operate at Layer 2, but they can sometimes perform Layer 3 functions (like routing) in advanced models.

---

### **Protocols at Layer 2**

* **Ethernet (IEEE 802.3)**
* **Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11)**
* **PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol)**
* **HDLC (High-Level Data Link Control)**
* **Frame Relay**
* **Token Ring** (obsolete)

---

### **Important Concepts**

* **Unicast, Broadcast, Multicast**: Delivery types based on MAC addressing.
* **MAC Address Table (Switching Table)**: Used by switches to forward frames to the correct port.
* **VLANs (Virtual LANs)**: Layer 2 feature that allows logical separation of networks on the same physical switch.

### **Comparison with Other Layers**

| OSI Layer              | Role                                                       |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Layer 1: Physical      | Transmits raw bits over a physical medium.                 |
| **Layer 2: Data Link** | Packages bits into frames and ensures error-free delivery. |
| Layer 3: Network       | Determines best path for data (routing).                   |

### **Real-World Example**

When your computer sends a packet over Ethernet:

1. Layer 3 adds an IP header.
2. Layer 2 wraps it in a frame, adds MAC addresses, and a CRC.
3. The switch reads the frame’s destination MAC address and forwards it to the correct port.
