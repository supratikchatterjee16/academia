# High Powered Computing

This is the set of processes involved in accelerating computation processes, through distribution and parallelization of the kernels.

NVIDIA is a major player in this market.

## Design Practice

### CUDA

For CUDA, NVIDIA suggests making use of the APOD design cycle, which have the following stages:

1. Assess
2. Parallelize
3. Optimize
4. Deploy

## Hardware Technologies Behind HPC

### **High-Performance Processors**

* **Multi-core CPUs** → Modern HPC clusters use CPUs with dozens of cores (AMD EPYC, Intel Xeon) for general-purpose tasks.
* **GPUs (Graphics Processing Units)** → Massively parallel processors (NVIDIA A100/H100, AMD Instinct) optimized for floating-point and tensor operations.
* **Accelerators**

  * **AI/ML chips** → Tensor Cores (NVIDIA), TPUs (Google).
  * **FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays)** → Custom accelerators for specialized workloads.

**Impact**: Provides raw compute power for simulation, modeling, AI, and scientific workloads.

### **Memory Technologies**

* **DRAM (High-capacity main memory)** → For storing working sets of data.
* **HBM (High Bandwidth Memory)** → Stacked memory with huge bandwidth (used in NVIDIA GPUs, AMD Instinct).
* **GDDR (Graphics DDR)** → High-speed GPU memory for throughput.
* **NVRAM / Persistent Memory** (e.g., Intel Optane) → Bridges gap between RAM and storage.
* **Cache Hierarchies (L1/L2/L3)** → Reduce latency in CPU/GPU data access.

**Impact**: Enables fast data access and minimizes bottlenecks in parallel workloads.

### **High-Speed Interconnects**

* **InfiniBand** → Low-latency, high-bandwidth networking for HPC clusters (Mellanox/NVIDIA).
* **NVLink / NVSwitch** → NVIDIA’s GPU-to-GPU high-bandwidth interconnect.
* **PCI Express (PCIe Gen5/Gen6)** → Standard CPU↔GPU and peripheral communication bus.
* **CXL (Compute Express Link)** → Emerging standard for coherent memory sharing across CPUs/accelerators.
* **Ethernet (100G/200G/400G)** → Still widely used in HPC and hyperscale data centers.

**Impact**: Critical for scaling HPC across thousands of nodes with minimal communication overhead.

### **Storage Systems**

* **Parallel File Systems** → Lustre, IBM Spectrum Scale (GPFS), BeeGFS → designed for massive throughput.
* **NVMe SSDs** → High-speed local storage for compute nodes.
* **Burst Buffers** → Fast SSD caches to absorb I/O spikes between compute and storage layers.
* **Object Storage** → Scalability for unstructured scientific data.

**Impact**: Efficiently handles terabytes–petabytes of data generated by simulations and AI workloads.

### **Energy & Cooling Solutions**

* **Liquid Cooling (direct-to-chip, immersion cooling)** → Needed for dense GPU clusters.
* **Efficient Power Delivery** → Optimized PSUs and voltage regulators.
* **Thermal-aware architectures** → Helps achieve performance without thermal throttling.

**Impact**: Keeps supercomputers efficient and sustainable at megawatt-scale power.

### **System Integration & Architecture**

* **Clustered Supercomputers** → Thousands of nodes connected via high-speed networks.
* **Heterogeneous Computing** → CPUs + GPUs + FPGAs working together.
* **Exascale Systems** → Modern HPC targets **>10^18 FLOPS** (e.g., Frontier, Aurora, El Capitan).
* **Node-level Innovations** → Dense GPU servers (e.g., NVIDIA DGX, AMD Instinct MI300-based systems).

**Impact**: Scales from single-node HPC servers to the world’s fastest supercomputers.
