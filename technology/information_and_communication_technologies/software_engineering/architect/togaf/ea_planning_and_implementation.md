# Enterprise Architecture Planning & Implementation

This has 8 phases that are done in a circular method. But it starts from the preliminary phase.

The 8 phases are :

1. Architecture Vision
2. Business Architecture
3. Information Systems Architecture
4. Technology Architecture
5. Opportunities and Solutions
6. Migration Planning
7. Implementation Governance
8. Architecture Change Management

key components to it are :

1. Requirements Management
2. Iteration and Landscape
3. Security
4. SOA
5. Architecture Principles
6. Stakeholder Management
7. Architecture Patterns
8. Business Scenarios

## Preliminary Phase

Uses 4 W and 1 H analysis(What, When, Who, Why, How)

- Define enterprise
- Identify key drivers and elements
- Define architecture requirements
- Define architecture principles
- Define framework
- Define relationships
- Evaluate maturity
- Business Process
- Skilled people

## Architecture Vision

Objectives :
- Develop vision of capabilities and business value
- Obtain approval for a Statement of Architectire Work

Approach :
- Receipt of a Request for Architecture Work
- Creating the Architecture Vision
    - Let tool to sell benefits to stakeholders
- Business Scenarios
    - Identify and articulate business requirements

Steps : 

1. Establish the architecture project
2. Identify any concerns, business requirements, and key stakeholders
3. Confirm business goals, drivers, and constraints
4. Evaluate Business capabilities
5. Assess readiness for transformation
6. Define scope
7. Confirm architecture principles
8. Develop architecture vision
9. Define the target architecture value and propositions and KPIs
10. Identify transformation risks and any mitigation activities
11. Develop statement of architecture work

Outputs:

- Approved Statement of Architecture Work
- Refined principles, goals, drivers
- Architecture principles
- Capability Assessments
- Tailored Architecture Framework
- Architecture Vision
- Draft Architecture definition document
- Communications plan
- Architecture repository

## Business Architecture

Objectives :
- Develop target business architecture
- Identify candidate architecture roadmap components

Approach

2. Develop a baseline description
3. Develop a target description
4. Perform Gap Analysis
5. Define Candidate Roadmap components
6. Resolve any impacts or implications
7. Conduct stakeholder reviews
8. Finalize the Business architecture
9. Create Architecture Definition Document

Outputs :

- refined version of Architecture Vision
