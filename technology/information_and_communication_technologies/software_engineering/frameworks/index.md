# Software Frameworks

A software framework is a reusable, customizable platform that provides a foundation for building software applications. It offers pre-built components, tools, and guidelines to streamline development, allowing developers to focus on unique project aspects rather than reinventing common functionalities. Frameworks enforce structure, improve code quality, and reduce development time by providing a pre-built architecture and reusable code.

The frameworks listed here are the major frameworks used for a particular technology requirement. Please check the sections to learn more on the categories covered here.
