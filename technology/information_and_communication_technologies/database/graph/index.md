# Graph DBs

Graph Databases are specialized NoSQL databases designed to model and store data as graphs. In this model, entities are represented as **nodes**, relationships between them as **edges**, and both nodes and edges can have **properties**. This structure is particularly effective for representing and querying complex relationships and interconnected data.

## Common Use Cases

Graph databases excel in scenarios where relationships between data points are as important as the data points themselves. Some prominent use cases include:

* **Social Networks**: Modeling user connections, friendships, and interactions.
* **Recommendation Engines**: Suggesting products or content based on user behavior and preferences.
* **Fraud Detection**: Identifying suspicious patterns and connections in financial transactions.
* **Knowledge Graphs**: Representing structured information for AI and semantic search applications.
* **Network and IT Operations**: Mapping and analyzing network topologies and dependencies.
* **Supply Chain Mapping**: Tracking and optimizing the flow of goods and information.
* **360Â° Customer Views**: Integrating data from various sources to get a comprehensive understanding of customers.

These use cases leverage the inherent strengths of graph databases in handling complex, interconnected data structures. ([Graph Database & Analytics][1])

## Common Languages and Structures for Transactions and Querying

Graph databases utilize specialized query languages tailored to their graph structures. Here's an overview of common languages and their characteristics:

* **Cypher (Neo4j, Memgraph, RedisGraph)**: A declarative, SQL-inspired language designed for property graphs. It's known for its readability and ease of use.
* **Gremlin (Apache TinkerPop, JanusGraph, Amazon Neptune)**: A functional, imperative language that supports both traversal and mutation of graph data.
* **SPARQL (GraphDB, Virtuoso, Amazon Neptune)**: A query language for RDF graphs, focusing on querying and manipulating linked data.
* **GQL (Graph Query Language)**: An emerging ISO standard for property graph querying, aiming to provide a unified language across graph databases. ([gqlstandards.org][2])
* **GraphQL**: Primarily used for APIs, it allows clients to request specific data structures, often used in conjunction with graph databases for frontend applications. ([memgraph.com][3])

| --------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Create    | `CREATE (n:Person {name: 'Alice'})` | `g.addV('person').property('name', 'Alice')`   | `INSERT DATA { GRAPH <g> { <#Alice> <name> 'Alice' } }`                         |
| Read      | `MATCH (n:Person) RETURN n`         | `g.V().hasLabel('person').values('name')`      | `SELECT ?name WHERE { ?s <name> ?name }`                                        |
| Update    | `MATCH (n:Person) SET n.age = 30`   | `g.V().hasLabel('person').property('age', 30)` | `DELETE { ?s <age> ?oldAge } INSERT { ?s <age> 30 } WHERE { ?s <age> ?oldAge }` |
| Delete    | `MATCH (n:Person) DELETE n`         | `g.V().hasLabel('person').drop()`              | `DELETE WHERE { ?s <name> 'Alice' }`                                            |
