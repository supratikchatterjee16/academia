# Monte Carlo

Used for risk analysis, through simulations of different probabilistic outcomes, within a pre-calculated tolerance limit, for the required metrics.
Monte Carlo simulation can be used to tackle a range of problems in virtually every field. It is also referred to as multiple probability simulation.

The basis of the simulation is to assign multiple values to an uncertain variable to achieve multiple results and the averaging the results to obtain an estimate.

It assumes perfectly efficient markets.
