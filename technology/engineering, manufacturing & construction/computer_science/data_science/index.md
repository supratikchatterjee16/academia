# Data Science

**Data Science** is an interdisciplinary field focused on extracting knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data using scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems. It integrates elements from statistics, computer science, mathematics, and domain expertise to support decision-making, predictions, and automation.

## üîç **What Is Data Science?**

At its core, **data science** involves:

* **Data collection** and acquisition
* **Data cleaning** and preprocessing
* **Data analysis** and exploration
* **Modeling and algorithms** for prediction or inference
* **Communicating results** using visualization and storytelling
* **Deployment and monitoring** of data products (like machine learning models)

It aims to **turn raw data into actionable insights**.

## **Major Topics in Data Science**

Here's a breakdown of the **core topics** typically included in a data science curriculum or role:

### 1. **Mathematics & Statistics**

* Descriptive and inferential statistics
* Probability theory
* Linear algebra (vectors, matrices)
* Calculus (mainly for optimization and understanding ML algorithms)
* Hypothesis testing
* Bayesian methods

### 2. **Programming & Software Tools**

* **Languages**: Python, R (sometimes SQL, Scala, Julia)
* **Libraries**: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, matplotlib/seaborn

* **Development tools**: Jupyter Notebooks, VS Code

### 3. **Data Wrangling & Preprocessing**

* Data cleaning (handling missing values, outliers)
* Data transformation and normalization
* Feature engineering
* Handling categorical and time series data
* Working with APIs and web scraping

### 4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

* Data visualization
* Summarizing distributions and relationships
* Identifying patterns, trends, anomalies

### 5. **Machine Learning**

* **Supervised learning** (regression, classification)
* **Unsupervised learning** (clustering, dimensionality reduction)
* **Model evaluation** (cross-validation, confusion matrix, ROC/AUC)
