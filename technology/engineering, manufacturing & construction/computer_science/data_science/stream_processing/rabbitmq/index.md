# RabbitMQ

RabbitMQ is an open-source message broker that implements the **AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol)**. It acts as a middleman between producers (senders) and consumers (receivers), enabling **asynchronous communication**, decoupling, and reliable delivery of messages in distributed systems.

* Written in **Erlang**, known for fault tolerance and concurrency.
* Supports **multiple messaging protocols** (AMQP, MQTT, STOMP).
* Used in microservices, event-driven architectures, and background job processing.

## **2. Key Features of RabbitMQ**

* **AMQP 0-9-1 and other protocols** (MQTT, STOMP, HTTP API).
* **Flexible routing** with exchanges (direct, topic, fanout, headers).
* **Durability & reliability** (persistent queues/messages, acknowledgements).
* **Clustering** (scale horizontally across nodes).
* **High availability** (mirrored queues / quorum queues).
* **Pluggable authentication & authorization**.
* **Management UI & monitoring** (built-in web dashboard).
* **Dead Letter Exchanges (DLX)** for error handling.
* **Message TTL & expiration**.
* **Publisher confirms** (ensure messages are safely stored).
* **Flexible consumer patterns** (competing consumers, work queues).
* **Multi-language clients** (Java, Python, Go, C#, etc.).

## **3. Core Concepts**

* **Producer** → Application that publishes messages.
* **Consumer** → Application that receives messages.
* **Queue** → Storage where messages wait until consumed.
* **Exchange** → Routes messages to queues based on rules. Types:

  * *Direct* → Exact match routing key.
  * *Topic* → Pattern-based routing (wildcards).
  * *Fanout* → Broadcast to all queues.
  * *Headers* → Based on headers instead of routing keys.
* **Binding** → Rule that links an exchange to a queue.
* **Acknowledgment (Ack/Nack)** → Confirms delivery, prevents message loss.
* **Durability** → Messages and queues survive broker restarts.
* **Prefetch Count** → Controls load balancing between consumers.
* **Dead Letter Exchange (DLX)** → Handles expired or rejected messages.

## **4. Using RabbitMQ with Java**

The official Java client library is **amqp-client**.

**Example (Producer in Java):**

```java
import com.rabbitmq.client.*;

public class Producer {
    private final static String QUEUE_NAME = "hello";

    public static void main(String[] argv) throws Exception {
        ConnectionFactory factory = new ConnectionFactory();
        factory.setHost("localhost");
        try (Connection connection = factory.newConnection();
             Channel channel = connection.createChannel()) {
            channel.queueDeclare(QUEUE_NAME, false, false, false, null);
            String message = "Hello, RabbitMQ!";
            channel.basicPublish("", QUEUE_NAME, null, message.getBytes());
            System.out.println(" [x] Sent '" + message + "'");
        }
    }
}
```

**Example (Consumer in Java):**

```java
import com.rabbitmq.client.*;

public class Consumer {
    private final static String QUEUE_NAME = "hello";

    public static void main(String[] argv) throws Exception {
        ConnectionFactory factory = new ConnectionFactory();
        factory.setHost("localhost");
        Connection connection = factory.newConnection();
        Channel channel = connection.createChannel();

        channel.queueDeclare(QUEUE_NAME, false, false, false, null);
        DeliverCallback deliverCallback = (consumerTag, delivery) -> {
            String message = new String(delivery.getBody(), "UTF-8");
            System.out.println(" [x] Received '" + message + "'");
        };
        channel.basicConsume(QUEUE_NAME, true, deliverCallback, consumerTag -> {});
    }
}
```

## **5. Using RabbitMQ with Python**

Most common library: **pika**.

**Example (Producer in Python):**

```python
import pika

connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters('localhost'))
channel = connection.channel()

channel.queue_declare(queue='hello')

channel.basic_publish(exchange='',
                      routing_key='hello',
                      body='Hello, RabbitMQ!')
print(" [x] Sent 'Hello, RabbitMQ!'")
connection.close()
```

**Example (Consumer in Python):**

```python
import pika

connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters('localhost'))
channel = connection.channel()

channel.queue_declare(queue='hello')

def callback(ch, method, properties, body):
    print(f" [x] Received {body}")

channel.basic_consume(queue='hello',
                      on_message_callback=callback,
                      auto_ack=True)

print(' [*] Waiting for messages. To exit press CTRL+C')
channel.start_consuming()
```

## **6. Comparison with Other MQ Systems**

| Feature           | RabbitMQ                        | Kafka                             | ActiveMQ           | Amazon SQS                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Protocol          | AMQP, MQTT, STOMP               | Custom (Kafka protocol)           | AMQP, OpenWire     | Proprietary                        |
| Focus             | General-purpose MQ              | High-throughput event streaming   | Traditional JMS MQ | Cloud-native MQ                    |
| Message Retention | Until consumed (or TTL)         | Log-based, configurable retention | Until consumed     | Configurable                       |
| Throughput        | Medium                          | Very high (millions/sec)          | Medium             | Medium                             |
| Ordering          | Per-queue                       | Partition-based                   | Per-queue          | Limited                            |
| Use Cases         | Task queues, RPC, microservices | Event sourcing, analytics         | Legacy JMS apps    | Cloud apps (serverless, AWS-based) |

In comparison to Kafka, this can be used for handling data extraction workloads better.

## **7. Pitfalls to Avoid**

* **Forgetting acknowledgements** → can lead to message loss or buildup.
* **Overusing auto_ack** → unsafe; prefer manual acknowledgements.
* **Unbounded queues** → can cause memory/CPU pressure.
* **Not handling dead letters** → failed messages keep retrying endlessly.
* **Ignoring connection/channel limits** → reuse connections, create multiple channels instead.
* **Not tuning prefetch** → can overload a single consumer while others idle.
* **Improper durability settings** → make queues/messages durable for critical systems.
* **Cluster misconceptions** → clustering doesn’t replicate queues by default; need mirrored/quorum queues.
* **Mixing transactional and high-throughput needs** → use publisher confirms, not full transactions.
