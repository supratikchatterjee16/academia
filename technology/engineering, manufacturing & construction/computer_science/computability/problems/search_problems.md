# Search Problems - Common Algorithms

Search algorithms are methods for exploring data structures or solution spaces to **find a specific value, goal, or optimal configuration**. They're foundational in **AI, pathfinding, game theory, databases, and optimization**.

Below is a structured list of **search algorithms**, categorized by purpose and properties.

## 1. **Uninformed (Blind) Search Algorithms**

These algorithms don‚Äôt use any domain-specific information.

| Algorithm                      | Strategy                           | Complete?     | Optimal?             | Time Complexity        |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** | Explores neighbors level by level  | ‚úÖ Yes         | ‚úÖ Yes (uniform cost) | O(b<sup>d</sup>)       |
| **Depth-First Search (DFS)**   | Explores one branch deeply first   | ‚úÖ (if finite) | ‚ùå No                 | O(b<sup>d</sup>)       |
| **Iterative Deepening DFS**    | DFS with increasing depth limit    | ‚úÖ Yes         | ‚úÖ Yes                | O(b<sup>d</sup>)       |
| **Uniform-Cost Search**        | Expands node with lowest path cost | ‚úÖ Yes         | ‚úÖ Yes                | O(b<sup>1+‚åäC/Œµ‚åã</sup>) |

> **b** = branching factor, **d** = depth of goal node, **C** = cost, **Œµ** = smallest step cost.

## üîç 2. **Informed (Heuristic) Search Algorithms**

Use a heuristic function `h(n)` to guide the search. Common in **AI and robotics**.

| Algorithm                    | Description                                       | Complete? | Optimal? | Notes                               |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------- | -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Greedy Best-First Search** | Chooses node with lowest `h(n)`                   | ‚ùå         | ‚ùå        | Fast but not always correct         |
| **A\***                      | Uses `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)` (path cost + heuristic) | ‚úÖ         | ‚úÖ        | Optimal if `h` is admissible        |
| **Beam Search**              | Keeps only best `k` nodes per level               | ‚ùå         | ‚ùå        | Tradeoff between speed and accuracy |
| **Iterative Deepening A\***  | A\* with depth limits                             | ‚úÖ         | ‚úÖ        | Space-efficient                     |

> A\* is widely used in **pathfinding**, e.g., GPS systems, games.

## üîó 3. **Local Search Algorithms**

Focus on **improving a single solution** iteratively. Good for large state spaces.

| Algorithm               | Description                                       | Notes                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Hill Climbing**       | Moves to better neighboring states                | Can get stuck in local maxima   |
| **Simulated Annealing** | Probabilistic jumps to escape local optima        | Slower but more global          |
| **Genetic Algorithms**  | Evolves solutions through crossover and mutation  | Works on populations            |
| **Tabu Search**         | Avoids cycles by tracking recently visited states | Good for combinatorial problems |

> Useful for **optimization**, especially when the search space is vast or poorly understood.

## 4. **Adversarial Search (Game Trees)**

Used in **game AI** or any setting with competing agents.

| Algorithm                          | Purpose                                   | Domain                 |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Minimax**                        | Chooses the move that minimizes loss      | Chess, Tic-Tac-Toe     |
| **Alpha-Beta Pruning**             | Prunes Minimax branches that won't help   | More efficient Minimax |
| **Expectimax**                     | Handles stochastic outcomes               | Dice games, backgammon |
| **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** | Simulates rollouts to estimate move value | Go, real-time strategy |

> Used in agents like **Deep Blue**, **AlphaGo**, and other game-playing AIs.

## 5. **Tree and Graph Traversal**
