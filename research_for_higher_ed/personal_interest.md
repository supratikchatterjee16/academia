I am Supratik Chatterjee, a Computer Science and Engineering graduate employed at TCS.
My official designation at TCS is a Systems Engineer. There is a 'Digital' profile within the company,
which results in me being part of New Product Development and Growth & Transformation projects.

As a part of New Product Development projects(8 initiatives by the time I write this, 2 of which are in use), I learnt about
innovation and creativity in companies, how to harness the creativity of individuals in order to formulate
Minimum Viable Product and devising new features, from techniques such as Brainstorming, Mind Maps, 
Starbursting, Worst Idea Analysis and others. When practising the same as a mentor, the one thing that I realized
is just how diverse creativity can be, and just how fascinating it can be to see it develop in an unconstrained
environment, when working around an anchoring subject.

The Growth and Transformation project I have been a part of, is an Omni-Channel simplification project,
for a multi-national retailer, wherein my focus was to ensure robustness of operations while enhancing their
Point-of-Service implementation provided by Oracle(components worked on were ORPOS, ORBO, ORCO),
and has little relevance to my interest.

I wish to explain just how old my interest in creativity and evolutionary systems/algorithms is, but in lieu of time,
I'll only say that I have been making not so well understood attempts at it, since grade 4. Only when I started facing challenges
at certain topics, such as developing a system for auto configuring and deploying micro websites
([Ghoul Server](https://github.com/supratikchatterjee16/MuSeNBaC)), or Coreference Resolution(NLP) in project [New Analysis and Summarization](https://github.com/supratikchatterjee16/nasty), and in more recent topics
such as packing economics in website UIs(https://github.com/supratikchatterjee16/workbench_v2), procedural terrain generation,
attempting super-structure design for simplified factories in 'Satisfactory'(a popular game)[link](https://github.com/supratikchatterjee16/satisfactory-notebook),
did I understand my interest in the specific topic of Computational Creativity.

This has further increased through studying use cases such as (Antennas using evolutionary Algorithms(NASA and JEM))[https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/m/pub-archive/1244h/1244%20(Hornby).pdf] and (OpenAI's demonstration of GANN on multi-agent game, with team based coordination)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu56xVlZ40M&vl=en]. 

## Ashok Goel

In one exploratory study, while attempting to find papers on 'Case Based Reasoning' for further work into Coreference resolution, I stumbled upon your paper. 'A Task Structure for Case-Based Design', which led me to find you, Professor Swaroop S. Vattam, Former Professor Tom Bylander, Assistant Professor Matthew Guzdial and Professor Spencer Rugaber.
