Hello Professor Askok K. Goel,

My name is Supratik Chatterjee. I am a Software Developer at TCS. I write to you to pursue full-time research in Computational Creativity under your guidance.

My work in TCS has been in Retail and Hospitality, Knowledge Management, New Product Development, and Growth & Transformation. As a part of New Product Development projects(9 initiatives to date, 2 of which are in use), I learned about innovation and creativity in companies, how to harness the creativity of individuals, to formulate a Minimum Viable Product, and devise new features, from techniques such as Brainstorming, Mind Maps, Starbursting, Worst Idea Analysis, and others.

Since six years ago, I have been finding various places where the implementation of Computational Creativity will benefit the projects. The first instance was in Anaphorical Reference Resolution in Natural Language. I was working towards using propositional logic to find inconsistencies within news articles and needed properly formed verb triples, or Relation-Triples(a concept from the Stanford CoreNLP project). 
(concept : [New Analysis and Summarization](https://github.com/supratikchatterjee16/nasty))

On a separate project, working with a designer made me realize that packing economics in website design was a major expense and a blind spot while structuring and creating concepts for websites. It is even more so for websites that use advertisements to generate revenue. Computational creativity can help strike a balance between the spaces and find possible restructure that helps organize the content and help low code platforms immensely.

A third instance was during an exploratory work on "procedural resource distribution" while creating a game as a hobby project with a friend of mine. It required prior distribution planning by the system due to working with the concept of 'seeding' for procedural terrain generation.

A fourth was when creating a planning algorithm within the popular game 'Satisfactory.' It is a game that involves logistical planning for resource acquisition and processing and factory structuring(to make it easy for people to work with making pretty structures rather than working with the planning component), using throughput values. For finding efficient packing and suggesting symmetric superstructures, computational creativity would be beneficial.

The interest further increased due to the following applications : 

1. [Antennas using Evolutionary Algorithms(NASA and JEM)](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/m/pub-archive/1244h/1244%20(Hornby).pdf)
2. [OpenAI's demonstration of GANN on a multi-agent game, with team-based coordination](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu56xVlZ40M&vl=en)


I became aware of computational creativity as a subject when researching subjective design for websites, which led me to your paper 'A Task Structure for Case-Based Design'. I have since then studied various works in its applications, such as 'From mitochondria to water harvesting: A case study in biologically inspired design' and 'GAIA: A CAD-Like Environment for Designing Game-Playing Agents'.

My interest is to research applications of constrained and unconstrained artificial creativity for Artificial General Intelligence, and I wish to do this under your guidance if possible. Additionally, if it already does not exist, I intend to formulate a process for improving its adoption in companies. I have attached my CV and college transcripts(graduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering) for your reference and will be much obliged if you would be willing to have me.

Regards,  
Supratik Chatterjee
