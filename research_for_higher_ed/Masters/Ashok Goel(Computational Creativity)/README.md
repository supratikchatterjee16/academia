## A Task Structure for Case-Based design

Applying Case Based Reasoning to systems, for solving the problem based on a previous case of a similar occurance. This makes use of heuristics based search of the space, to identify the target to the current 'challenge'. 

Major components : 

1. Task Analysis
2. Behaviour-to-Structure Design Task
3. Methods for solving the design task
4. Design Modification Task
5. Methods of Solving the Design Modification task
6. Modification Proposition
7. Methods for solving the Modification-Proposition Task

Novelty : 

ETL process for solving design task : 
1. design retrieval
2. design adaptation
3. design storage 

Subtasks for Design Modification Task :

1. modification proposition
2. modification evaluation
3. modification ececution


Some important references provided : 
### On the topic of task analysis

Relyng on Chandrasekran's work

Task Analysis is broken down into : 

1. Task Specufication
2. Method Identifiation
3. Method Selection
4. Recursive Task-Method Analysis


### On the topic of solving design task

The behavior-to-structure design task can be po-
tentially solved by a number of methods [Goel
1989] including the methods of :

1. heuristic association
2. heuristic search
3. constraint satisfaction
4. deductive logic
5. design decomposition
6. plan instantiation
7. case-based reasoning.
