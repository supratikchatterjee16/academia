# Course selection Masters

I enjoy working with creativity and innovation.
Making something new and useful.
This requires the ability to find something new.

Towards this end, there are 2 paths that can be chosen according to my prior research.

An academic approach, which has lesser financial gains, but is far more satisfying, and
a business driven approach which has higher financial gains but lesser satisfaction.

## Academic Path

The desired goal is to work with computational creativity and it's application in robotics if possible.

While robotics doesn't necissitate me taking a course particularly in that domain, I will need a course oriented towards computational creativity. So any course offering this is fair game.

Good to have specialization details is basics of High Performance Computing, but again it isn't really a topic that is all that hard to catch up to.

A brief search yields the following courses : 

### Georgia University

Course CS 7601(old), CS 8803(new)
Primary professor : Ashok Goel

Specializations offered in :

1. Interactive Intelligence(MSCS)
2. Human Centered Computing(MSCS)

### Northwestern University

This has a list of courses with awful IDs. But it offers computational creativity.

### Aalto University(Finland)

Course CS-E4002 deals with Computational Creativity.
This university does not have a lot of clout/reach, but it has a pretty high QS ranking.

### Queen's University(Canada)(Personal Preference)

This does not disappoint. The course CISC 110 is a part of the undergraduate curriculum, which can be studied by others as well

### University of Waterloo(Canada)

Has faculty that dabbles in this.

### Santa Clara University(USA)

Professor Maya Ackermann teaches this.

### Carleton University

### University of Alberta

The university does not offer a course, but has an individual involved with this named 
Matthew Guzdial, who happens to be in contact with Professor Ashok Goel.

His specialization is Machine Learning Creativity, who happens to be leading a lab named GRAIL,
at Alberta University.

He works with Professor Nathan Sturtevant on a common topic, using the creativity to solve games and make game agents.

## Business Path

The only human like work is Business Analytics. If you don't have a business, the only method to do something human is to become a business analyst. Towards this end, we make use of our specialization in computer science to be able to quantify processes and to be able to visualize it.

The requirements for this is to undertake a course offering Operational Research and Data Visualization in a business setup.
