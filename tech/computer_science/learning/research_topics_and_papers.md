# Topics an Papers of interest

## Aim

Primary topic of interest is creativity in computers.

The topic is a mix of concepts spreading over the topics of
fuzzy logic, neural networks, knowledge management, data wrangling.

Application for these will invove topics in Human Computer Interface,
which will include specializations in the area of sonography, computer vision,
natural language processing and quite possibly elements of automation.

## Neural Networks

### Artificial Neural Networks

#### Neocognitron

The neocognitron is a hierarchical, multilayered artificial neural network proposed by Kunihiko Fukushima in 1979.
It has been used for Japanese handwritten character recognition and other pattern recognition tasks, and served as the inspiration for convolutional neural networks.


The neocognitron was inspired by the model proposed by Hubel & Wiesel in 1959. They found two types of cells in the visual primary cortex called simple cell and complex cell, and also proposed a cascading model of these two types of cells for use in pattern recognition tasks.

#### Spiking Neuron Model

A neural network model that incorporates time additionally to neuronal and synaptic states, in their operating models.
The idea is that neurons in the SNN do not transmit information at each propagation cycle (as it happens with typical multi-layer perceptron networks), but rather transmit information only when a membrane potential – an intrinsic quality of the neuron related to its membrane electrical charge – reaches a specific value, called the threshold. When the membrane potential reaches the threshold, the neuron fires, and generates a signal that travels to other neurons which, in turn, increase or decrease their potentials in response to this signal. A neuron model that fires at the moment of threshold crossing is also called a spiking neuron model.

## Self Organizing Maps

### Hybrid Kohonen self-organizing map

In artificial neural networks, a hybrid Kohonen self-organizing map is a type of self-organizing map (SOM) named for the Finnish professor Teuvo Kohonen, where the network architecture consists of an input layer fully connected to a 2–D SOM or Kohonen layer. 

The output from the Kohonen layer, which is the winning neuron, feeds into a hidden layer and finally into an output layer. In other words, the Kohonen SOM is the front–end, while the hidden and output layer of a multilayer perceptron is the back–end of the hybrid Kohonen SOM. The hybrid Kohonen SOM was first applied to machine vision systems for image classification and recognition.
