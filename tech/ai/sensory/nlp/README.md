# Natural Language Processing

Content from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing)

Natural Language Processing is the set of processes governing how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. The ultimate goal is to "understand" the contents of documents, articles, etc. and being able to accurately extract information and insights contained within them.

It is a subfield of linguistcs, computer science and artificial intelligence.

Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition, natural-language understanding and natural-language generation.

## Text and Speech Processing
